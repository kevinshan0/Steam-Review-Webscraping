This is a game that completely changes based on how you play it and how long you've played it for.
At the 0 hour mark,
BTD6 is a cute monkey tower defense game that seems fairly straight forward. You just place down monkeys, and these colored balloons called "bloons" come that your little monkeys pop with darts. Your favorite Hero is Quincy, because he's all you have.
At the 25 hour mark,
you might have had a couple of people tell you what's "good" or "OP" in the game, then you start using these towers and upgrades for all your games. However, you still have no real understanding of what's going on in the game whatsoever, fumbling around in the dark and dying randomly to rounds all of a sudden when you thought you were doing great. Your favorite Hero is Striker Jones, and certainly not for the right reasons.
At the 50 hour mark,
you seem to find more towers and upgrades that seem to work or seem good. You might even start to catch on to the common "problem" rounds like 63, or start to think that you know a thing or two about the game. This is however, a fleeting illusion. And I assure you that you know nothing. Your favorite Hero is Obyn, because RISE!
At the 100 hour mark,
you've won many games on many maps and difficulties. You may have even won your first C.H.I.M.P.S. game by following a guide. You start to think you're good at the game. What short-sighted vision! 90% of the game can still completely crush you at this point. You may even be tempted into purchasing completely pointless micro-transactions now that you're already hooked. Rest assured that doing so is completely pointless and will not make you any better at the game. There are a few rather brutal (you think) game modes *cough* Half Cash *cough* Apopcalyse *cough* which for the life of you, just can't beat. Your favorite Hero is DJ Benjamin, because let's face it, we were all there someday.
At the 250 hour mark,
you've really started raking in the Monkey Money just by finishing maps and playing the game. You've already bought all the heroes and their skins. At this point, you start becoming increasingly greedy for game completion, you want those fancy looking "Black Borders" everyone is talking about. Unfortunately, you just haven't put enough time into the game at this point to have the knowledge or skill to beat all the game modes legitimately, and so you spam Cash Drops for hard game modes like Half Cash, and beat C.H.I.M.P.S. by watching guides. You fool yourself into thinking that you're a superior Bloons player, when you are in reality just a chimp. Your favorite Hero is Adora, because you think she's good when she's not.
At the 500 hour mark,
for the first time you truly start to wonder: what the **** is actually going on in this game? I've watched monkeys pop "bloons" for 500 hours, but in truth, I understand nothing. Your thirst for understanding game mechanics deepens and your search for the truth begins. You join Discord servers seeking for knowledge from superior Bloons players (who just troll you, reply in esoteric memes, and say things like "vrej"), spending hours reading long complicated Reddit posts and crawling through Google spreadsheets. Finally, you learn some proper terminology like "damage" and "pierce". Where was all this information in the game? You ask yourself. The striking revelation hits you like roaring thunder: It's simply not there! Nothing in the game tells you anything! "tHiS iS A bIg pLaNe", really? You even start reading those long detailed patch notes from every update. Your favorite Hero is Pat Fusty, because he's actually good.
After playing the game for 1000 hours,
for the first time, you actually feel like you understand the game just a little bit. And rest assured, if you've put that many hours into the game, you probably do understand it just a little. At this point, you can finally beat every game mode in the game legitimately. You may have even completed the easier Expert maps on C.H.I.M.P.S. You've found your way. No longer do you rely on any of the intentionally badly designed game "features" characteristic of mobile games. Cash Drops, Powers, and Instas become completely useless and pointless. The last time you've pulled out a Cash Drop was more than 500 hours of playtime ago. They're probably all piling up in the back closet like a mass of adult toys. Now all you want is to beat those hardest maps in the game. What they didn't tell you is that simply beating them all is not the end. Your favorite Hero is Quincy, the starter Hero, because he can beat every map on every game mode.
At the 1500 hour mark,
your priorities shift again. Your only goal is to become even better at the game. You realize completion is pointless and the only real growth is in experience and skill. You challenge yourself with the hardest game modes on the hardest maps in the game. But even that isn't enough, so you move into Challenge Editor to create and beat even harder game modes that don't even exist in the main game. C.H.I.M.P.S.? Why not try C.H.I.M.P.S. with only 2 Towers, or only 4th Tier towers, or only 1 DPS tower, or A.B.R. C.H.I.M.P.S., or C.H.I.M.P.S. with Triple HP MOABs. The possibilities are truly endless. Original theorycrafting also starts to come online at this playtime. You tap into secret knowledge known only to the most elite high-level Bloons players and think of completely new ways of understanding different parts of the game. Mastered Mortar micro? Try Ace micro. Haven't heard of RNG-manip in Bloons? Maybe you'll be the first to discover it. You start to question your favorite Hero, because even he can't beat some of these tough challenges.
At the 3000 hour mark,
you break through into the league of God tier Bloons players. Anything even in the main game becomes completely trivial. Name any 3 towers, and you will beat almost any map on any game mode with them first try. You turn off Monkey Knowledge because it makes the game even easier than it already is. You play every game with C.H.I.M.P.S. rules, and not even intentionally. If it was possible, you would Half your Cash for all games just for kicks. #Ouch becomes Couch and Puddles becomes Cuddles. Custom Challenges become trivial too. 2TC is a joke. Try Half Cash C.H.I.M.P.S. on Rake.  Your favorite Hero is Adora, because you did 2MPC on X Factor with her.
The next challenge... is Reverse Half Cash A.B.R. Triple HP MOABs Double HP Ceramics Quadruple Bloon Speed C.H.I.M.P.S. on Bloody Puddles.
At the 4000 hour mark,
you return to the depths of filthy and paltry casual gameplay. You've played this monkey game for so many hours that all the endless chasing of top 3 medals and pushing of the skill ceiling has become... meaningless. You've already done it all and yet you've accomplished... nothing. What is there left to do other than make meme custom maps, impossible challenges and play C.H.I.M.P.S. on "Your Mom but at a different angle"? Or as DJ Benjamin says, "Turn up the Double Cash!"
Psi... is this really the end?

→ Bloons TD 6 is set in a near-orwellian dystopian future where humanity's evolution has taken an alternate path; Evolving us into hyper-intelligent monkeys running a banana-fueled economy, which has been propped up precariously with a monkey housing-market shadow-banking scheme (but with banana bucks and bloons). Use government sponsored bloon-money (read: blood-money) to hire genetically engineered super-monkeys, psychopathic mercenary soldiers, surgically-enhanced unfeeling cyborgs, feed live sacrifices to the monkey Sun God, and to generally create horrendous weapons of mass poppage that will help you on your monkey business preventing the EXTREMIST Bloon terrorists from passing through and INFLATING the monkey economy, POPPING the housing-market bubble your monkey government has entrusted you, Big Brother, to protect. Do your duty and prevent BILLIONS of innocent monkeys from spiralling into homelessness and poverty by keeping bloon-kind chained where they belong, floating the economy and holding up Big Banana Goverment.
== The gameplay ==
→ BTD6 is a highly addicting tower defense game with amusing and diverse paths to create the mystifyingly satisfying noise that is balloons popping. (If you like the sound made by messing with bubble wrap, you've just found your gamer crack.) You start off placing your typically cheap monkeys-for-hire on the track, and gain progressive account-bound experience that unlocks tower upgrades and points for a monkey talent-tree that keeps you coming back for another go, while also keeping you from being overwhelmed by the insane mass of tower options and build paths you eventually have straight from the beginning. By the end of it you'll be plopping down mortars that can focus fire anywhere on the screen, helicopters that follow your cursor (or the enemy bloons if you're lazy), druids who spam chain lightning, and even necromancers who resurrect zombie bloons that move backwards on the track, popping their former brethren.
== On the pay-to-win issue ==
→ Even if you're a player like me who typically hates grinding for unlocks, the gameplay is so satisfying I felt like I was making typical progress in a monkey RTS / RPG rather than being slogged down and penalized for not making in-game purchases. The pay-to-win isn't much of an issue in multiplayer either (it just means an easy co-op win).
→ If you're having trouble with the progression I recommend spiking your upgrade unlock rate without spending real money in a couple of ways:
(A) Git gud and out-scale the bloon waves past the end wave into freeplay mode for BIG wads of player XP
(B) Run a few maps blazing-fast over-and-over again for wave-based XP that goes towards towers present on the screen.
(C) Getting lots of free the micro-transaction currency from first time map wins and challenges (hint: there is sometimes big bonus currency for winning a randomly selected map on each difficulty tier even after you've 100%'d, bigger on higher difficulty, and quests given on the home screen for even more).
(D) use free OP towers you get from near-constant in-game events and map victories for play-to-win ez mode on challenges and maps you're too lazy to tryhard on, or
(E) get carried by the bored 1000-hour randos in easy/intermediate queue who've ended up with WAAAY too much free micro-transaction currency and map-victory towers in co-op queue.
== Some things of note + tips ==
1) In co-op mode, the dev has made a brilliant design decision to prevent actual text typing and you instead communicate through a monkey-see monkey-do style emote menu. Communicate like its monkey Dark Souls.
2) There is a massive, extremely NOT-casual difficulty spike as you go upwards towards expert maps. Get together with the bros for co-op and rip out your hair together while having tons of headache-inducing fun in voice chat on Discord, scheming how the hell you're supposed to win without backing onto your play-to-win towers that are straight-out disabled on certain challenges.
3) I've seen this game on sale for $0.99 at least twice so far at the time of this writing, pop it on your wishlist and you might catch it that way again.
4) By some form of dark magic, this game has an active Youtube community with lots of gameplay tips, tricks, and mind-exploding big brain tower micro for you to dig up. Give it a search!
== TL;DR == go try Bloons TD 5 on NinjaKiwi's website and imagine that but better

The monkeys have developed multiple nuclear warheads and literally summoned God so they can pop these balloons. The least you can do is spend a few dollars.
Just skip going out for dinner one night and spend the money you would've used for food on this instead. Think about the children. Think about the starving monkeys of Monkeydom struggling because of the war against balloons, who may need the food more than you.

I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2020 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

The eighth entry in the Bloons Tower Defense universe, BTD6 does not dissapoint. It stands as a grisly and realistic representation of war, and it does a very good job of what it set out to be. An emotional journey from start to finish, forcing you to question the morality of your very being. It pits brother against brother in a violent war of attrition, and it doesn't shy away from covering controversial topics considered too problematic for media today. The protagonist himself isn't a cookie-cutter perfect individual either. He has flaws which are expressed extremely well and serve as a driving force for the main story, making you question his next move. BTD6 does a superb job of putting you in the shoes of its characters and forming connections to them. You feel what they feel every step of the way. It's chock full of emotional scenes that will leave you sobbing one moment, then filled with hope the next. BTD6 is a wonderfully crafted game, with substance that will keep you going for months.
If there is only one piece of media you need to experience in your life, it is Bloons Tower Defense 6.
Truly, a masterpiece of a game.

The monkeys make the ballons pop.. I think
Posted: January 12, 2021
So many times I'll see the dismissive and insulting put down of a game on here - "it's a poor mobile port". And I mean, in a lot of cases, they're not wrong. A lot of junk does get pulled over from mobile and often with an inflated price tag too, and often done quite lazily.
Happily while this IS very much a mobile game, it is a shining example of how to do it right, and just because it lives on mobile, it CAN exist here too.
Right off the bat, this is obviously a Tower Defence game, so of course it works well on mobile screens. However, it is not a lazy copy/paste of other games. It very much does it's own thing and after at least 5 other main entries, they've refined and added so much to make it a compelling and quite deep game all round.
Plenty of maps, and the "towers" in this game are the monkeys who have different abilities. YOu have your basics here - the basic single shot type, the area of effect blaster, the elemental or explosive attackers too. But it's more diverse than that. It's by no means a simple rock/paper/scissors that so many tower defence games descend into, where you have to pre-empt the next wave and build towers to suit.
No, this game has monkeys which can only be used on certain types of land (and in later stages, the land gets rather minimal too), have really diverse capabilities to combat enemies like camouflaged balloons that only they will track or reveal, or metal balloons that require a sniper or cannon type to pierce. So the balancing act here is much deeper and entertaining, especially when you get to harder difficulties.
The "enemies" in the game, being the balloons themselves, and they are MANY! There's something lovely and cathartic about hearing shedloads of balloons get popped at once, and this lends to the enjoyment well. Later waves will often become overwhelming instantly if you've made poor choices in tackling them ,as there's just that many that come in waves. But despite this, it's fair. If you mess up, you learn what you did wrong and fix it next time.
On top of this, there's a basic levelling/XP system where levelling up rewards you with XP points to improve your monkey's abilities slightly. Again, this is a great help with harder difficulties and later maps, and I feel is REALLY well balanced. You earn about at the right rate as you play. It's so easy to get that bit wrong.
On top of this, there's added frippery like cosmetics and UI changes and so on if you wish for it, as well as daily, weekly and monthly custom challenges and seasonal events. These are usually rewarded with different skins, or heroes or sometimes new monkeys themselves.
All in all it's not only well polished, well paced and deep enough to keep coming back to, but it has enough there for repeated play even if you finish the main game (which I'll point at out 60 hours in myself, I still have not finished).
So, as tower defence games go, this is right up there with Defense Grid, Sanctum and some of the other shining examples. Don't overlook it as a mobile cash in because it isn't. If you like tower defence you will absolutely love this, especially if you like the cute aesthetic. Ninja Kiwi seem well involved in keeping up interest with the events and challenges so I doubt anyone would tire of this quickly at all.

Fabulous little time waster, co-op mode makes for a hilarious experience with friends, especially in the later rounds when utter chaos ensues. There are regular events and challenges to keep you busy, an enormous range of maps to unlock and it truly builds so much further on the past games to create a unique and enjoyable experience. Would absolutely recommend to anyone thinking of buying.

This review was last updated December 10th 2019, as of version 13.0.
As a fan of BTD5 and playing since BTD4, I would overall recommend this game, despite my main concern with the micro-transactions, and a few minor things, which I expect they will add in the future. So I am a little mixed on it because of the micro-transactions.
I'll first talk about some of the things I do enjoy about BTD6 over BTD5:
Pros:
Three upgrade paths for every tower as opposed to two from BTD5.
A final fifth upgrade for each of those tiers
Two new towers, the Alchemist and Druid
A new monkey knowledge system for global upgrades, which I'm personally not a huge fan of it, but that's just my opinion
New Bloons, like Purple Bloons, the B.A.D. and the D.D.T. from other BTD games, and fortified bloons types that are tougher and can go on most any Bloon
A whole new cover and line-of-site system with obstacles that block line of sight for towers on more advanced maps, and that you can remove to create space, and you can also build structures to make areas for your towers to go on, not to mention placing monkeys atop some areas to create a height advantage to shoot over obstacles
Heroes; which are monkeys you can select from and place one on the battlefield to upgrade over time
So overall there are a lot of good things with this game compared to BTD5, which was awesome.
But, there are some concerns about some of the micro-transactions that make me have mixed feelings about this game, overall I would still give it a positive review, but I'll type my concerns with the cons of the game.
Cons:
I'll get in to some of the minor ones as of now and discuss my main concern later.
But overall, I don't have many complaints so far except for the micro-transactions, which I go into great detail below.
Not a lot of variety on what you can spend money on in-game, mostly heroes and one time abilities
Not all the towers from other BTD games are added, but they have new towers and recently added the Engineer monkey with new upgrades, so it's promising that the Bloonchipper and Darling Gunner may be added too
That's all I could really think of for my more minor complaints, which I'm perfectly fine with looking over for the early stage of the game, which there should be more content coming according to the store page, and hopefully some more maps and the missing towers will be part of that. So as far as these complaints, I understand perfectly for the stage of the game.
On to my main main concern:
Micro-transactions are my main concern about the game as I've stated multiple times; it's not needed or anything to progress in the game and still enjoy it, but I would honestly love this game if they didn't do it the way they currently have it. And I've read other reviews from people complaining about this, and the developers responded to multiple people stating what I said above about it not being necessary. But I'm really disappointed with the micro-transactions still, compared to BTD5 which had upgrades like these, (specifically double cash mode) and they could be bought for in-game money, which is awesome!
Sadly, this is not the case for BTD6 as of now, and I really hope that will change.
It's also disappointing because even with the increased price on PC, ($4.99 on mobile VS. $9.99 on PC for BTD6)
they still have micro-transactions you can only purchase if you pay money for it. Which is really stupid because of the increased price compared to mobile VS. PC. And just the double money costs $17.99 compared to the $9.99 game.
To me it feels like they're keeping a feature out of the game that you have to pay for if you want it. That depends how you look at it though. While yes, I've stated it isn't needed to still enjoy the game, it still just makes me iffy about the game in general because of this. This isn't free-to-play after all. (Not that it's a very expensive game though)
Overall, reading other reviews from people stating their concern with the micro-transactions, and how I feel about them too, I really wish they would listen and make those available for some time and effort into the game, or real money if you don't want to spend the time working toward it. (Just please not the awful grindy system of Bloons Monkey City)
To be honest, I think they could take a lesson from BTD5, because that was an awesome game on PC in this regard.
But in general, if it wasn't for the micro-transactions, I would love this game, assuming they still add more stuff as I'm sure they will.
But, because of that, I'm a little mixed about my review, but I would still give it a positive review.
(And if the devs do read this, thank you for your time. And please consider the community's feedback, I'm not the only one that feels this way, I think in general people would prefer BTD5's style in this matter. Because I'm not against having this in a game as an option for people who don't want to spend time, but to make it where you must pay for content in the game feels a little lacking, I think it should be unlocked like in BTD5.)
And after saying that, I realize DLC is exactly what I explained there, but compared to BTD5 this feels like a step in the wrong direction for PC. As I pointed out, the game is more expensive on Steam than on mobile.
Posted: February 17, 2020
I was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be. Currently having too much fun with this game.

After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:
If you like tower defence games: I recommend.
If you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.
If you want something casual and chill: I recommend.
If you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.
The tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special "paragon" towers)
The game devs have been providing free updates for years.
There's lots of achievements and medals to get.
There's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.
The game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!

Hi, i'm bout 10 hours into the game and uuuh its alrite i guess.
Edit: So uuh just wanted to edit the review a bit, i'm like uhh 100 hours in and the game is pretty fun ... yea i like it.
Edit: Hi, its me again ... so im like 400 hours into the game and my wife left me saying i didn't spend enough time with her and i got fired from my job after not showing up .... but at least the game is still super fun and addictive 😌.

I live in a one story house in the suburbs, my address is 308 Negro Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque New Mexico 87104, my name is Banana Bateman. I am 27 years old. I believe in wiping out bloons as a whole, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a bit bloon like I'll put on an ice pack while practicing throwing darts at bloons, I can pop a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I hop on my computer and boot up Bloons TD 6 to start my bloon poping genocide for the day. I pick my favorite map, Monkey Meadow. I usually like to start out with Sauda and a dart monkey. I'll save up to start buying banana farms which I upgrade to 2-0-0. I will then farm till I am able to buy my favorite tower, the super monkey. After I then start the process to obtain the vengeful true sun god, once done I leave my computer, grab my banana bunch, and leave for work. By the time I get back the game will usually end on round 268, my best is round 302. There is an idea of a bloons player. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real player. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our playstyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.

GUYS HELP I HAVE BEEN PLAYING BLOONS FOR 5 DAYS STRAIGHT, I HAVE NOW MEMORISED EVERY ROUND OF CHIMPS, THE EXACT AMOUNT OF LAYERS OF BLOON WITHIN A MOAB AND I NOW HAVE AN UNHEALTHY ($EXUA1) ADDICTION WITH THE (POP)ULAR HERO PAT FUSTY. PLEASE HELP ME I LIVE IN AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND. SEND HELP, MONKEY MONEY AND A FREE PAT FUSTY SHIRT (THE WHITE ONE NOT THE YUCKY BLACK ONE), WITH THE PAT FUSTY MUG (SO I CAN DRINK OUT OF PAT FUSTY). THANKS IN ADWG4RRGD5RESH5HSDFGE5YHWERGEW5HU6RUIJFUSTYRH5RGRFURRRRFATGPUSTYEWRGV.
