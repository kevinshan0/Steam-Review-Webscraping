Over 500 hours. Billions of men died for me. Millions of square mileage conquered by me. Thousands of countries have fallen to me. Hundreds of nuclear weapons detonated at my command. A couple dozen Hitlers deposed by me.
And I still don't know how to use navy.

So, I decided to go with Luxembourg, since hey, might as well try something hard right?
I spent meny years improving my nation's industry and infrastructure. After building up I thought it'd be nice to have some friends and wanted to buddy up with the mighty UK. They didn't want me in, thinking I'm too weak and pathetic. Then it all began. I swore vengeance on those damn imperialist. I began to plot my revenge. I hired a fascist demagogue to change my ideology while rushing nuclear research despite the massive penalties. After a succesful coup, or as it will be known in Luxembourgian history - unification of my people under one banner I joined the Axis since both Germany and me had mutual enemies. With their help I was able to unite the Benelux region under my rule, gaining more precious factories and people to force into my legions. I helped the mighty Reich in conquest of France, being rewarded with another small chunk of land. Everything was going according to my plan. But then a certain Austrian thought it'd be smart to attack the USSR. At first everything was fine, but then, oh god... Then the blasted British landed troops in France. So here I was facing the hordes of imperialist pigs while my best pal was off in Russia causing havoc. But I knew what I had to do. I had to stall them as long as possible, and that I did. Eventually Italaians and few Germans came to help and the British advance was slowed down or even halted at times. Good, good, just a bit more time. I'll show those islanders how "weak and pathetic" I am. I'll show them. In late 1944 the first nuclear bomb was produced. But I couldn't drop it without air superiority, so I waited and built up more airforce to help the Germans win the air war in the regions. And the help I provided proved very significant, the might Luxembourgian air force dominated the skies and allowed me to drop my revenge. Oh what a wonderful sight it was to see London in ruins. Does this seem weak or pathetic to you? Does it? Thought so. Sould've accepted my into yourfaction you wankers.
11/10 Would nuke London again

Edit: I first wrote this review several years ago and it's continued to receive likes and awards but was no longer relevant to the current state of the game, so I've decided to update it to reflect how I feel about the game now (Autumn 2021).
The issues I identified originally:
1: Germany is far too weak: This was fixed as I suggested by increasing production and adding crippling morale penalties to France
2: The British Empire is hyper aggressive: This was also fixed by reducing Britain's production and adding penalties making it hard to militarise the UK before the war actually starts.
3: Air casualties are far too high: This has also been fixed and air casulaties are reasonable. Major nations should no longer be out of fighters in the first month of the war.
4: Balancing certain air missions seems to be off: This was largely fixed. I still think Strategic bombing is a waste of time - mostly because the upfront investment to even build strategic bombers is just too high (see my new criticisms below)
5: Naval stacking doesn't seem to cause a penalty: Penalties have been added, so it no longer makes sense to just have one doomfleet.
I stand by my original claim that these are balancing tweaks and they have been largely tweaked away.
I also identified that there was a problem with fuel not being treated as a consumable resource which removed many of the historical pressures and reasons why nations acted like they did. This was fixed by Paradox some time ago, and fuel is now a very real pressure for Germany and Japan as it was historically.
However, there are now some new and slightly annoying balancing tweaks which I'd like to see addressed:
1. There are too many research options and too few slots/research takes too long. As it currently is, they've added so many things to research, many of them very cool, but there's no way to research them without totally hobbling yourself. For example, historically the UK managed to keep on top of basically all sorts of aircraft designs, ship designs, medium, light and heavy tank designs (plus associated TDs), infantry equipment designs, and various secret projects like RADAR and nuclear weapons. In game there just isn't the capacity to do this. You're likely going to likely only research one type of tank (light then medium), one type of bomber (probably CAS or TAC), and probably fall behind on capital ships, due to the lack of research capacity. I have so far never bothered to even research scout planes because it feels like the research slot is always better deployed on something (anything) else. I think there should be some more ways to specialise national research. In HOI 3 this was through the research organisations giving particular bonuses. I think this should make a comeback via the 'concerns' in the politics menu - these already offer some bonuses in some cases but I think this should be extended greatly. I also think they should be easier to appoint earlier so that you can specialise earlier. Perhaps appointing your first concern for an area should be cheaper, but changing later more expensive.
2. Similarly, production even for very industrial nations like Germany doesn't feel strong enough to keep up with all the options. This obviously needs to be a limiting factor as it was historically but usually it just doesn't make sense to build any of the more esoteric units, e.g. swimming tanks, or self-propelled rocket artillery, because throwing factories at infantry equipment is *so much more important*. This leads to most nations playing the same - build infantry equipment, support equipment, trucks, artillery, fighters, CAS, medium tanks. Deviation is a great way to run out of equipment and lose the war. Obviously these pressures are key to how the game works, but it feels like there needs to be some sort of system to encourage diversification. Perhaps for example, factories could be more nuanced than 'military' or 'civilian' - a light arms factory is very different from a car factory. Perhaps a car factory could be re-purposed to produce vehicles but not guns.
I still think the mechanics are the best they've ever been. In comparison to HOI3 it's a far more streamlined experience, and managing your forces is so much easier. No more screwing around with endless levels of military hierarchy and hundreds and hundreds of generals who all become interchangeable anyway. Here there are only four levels - division, army, group and theatre - and you assign generals to armies and Field Marshalls to Groups. Similarly, while in HOI3 manageing your airforce was such an enormous pain, and the effects of air superiority so minor that it basically was not worth it, here air power is much much easier to control and project and will be central to your overall strategy. Navies have also had a makeover although I haven't yet played any major sea power so won't comment on their effectiveness.
There's also an entirely new production system which is 1: vastly superior and 2: makes a lot more sense. Whereas previously you "built" divisions, here each division requires particular equipment dictated by its design as well as time to train. In terms of equipment they need guns, supplies, artillery, anti-tank guns, and particular vehicles, all of which need to be produced by your production lines which you set up and control. The way that this equipment is then handled means that upgrades are simulated much more realistically. In HOI3 a brigade used the previous technology until 100% upgraded, and this made no sense: your Panzer 3s had little percentage meters which when filled magiced them into Panzer 4s, your infantry used 1936 weapons until *every single 1938 weapon they needed arrived* then switched. Here divisions use whatever they can get from the stockpile, meaning that your divisions take delivery of new equipment as it arrives and replace losses with whatever you have available. So for example if your tank production doesn't keep up, your panzer divisions will fill the missing slots with whatever old crap was sitting in the depot. Oh and about that time to train - if the Motherland needs divisions comrade, you can simply hand them a rifle from the pile and point them at the Germans...
Finally the AI is better in several respects. For example it is far better at naval invasions now (in fact, it's a bit too keen on them) so Britain doesn't sit around uselessly unless player controlled. It's also much better at manageing forces and maintaining a front line so it's not so prone to huge encirclements. It seems to handle terrain better too, and pick good places to push and excellent defensive positions (which can grind things to a halt). It also seems to be a lot less predictable and capable of pulling off some rather complicated plans - I saw, for example, Japan launch an enormous pincer maneuvre on China, invading from both the North and South and cutting the country in half, trapping most of the Chinese forces out of supply. It's had some problems in the past with over-committing on low priority fronts but it seems to have improved in this regard in recent patches.
Overall this is, in my opinion, *the* WW2 grand strategy game. I keep coming back to it and lose hours every time I do.

This game vs. HOI3:
---------------------
Advantages:
1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3.
2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like.
3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.
4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC.
5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.
6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.
7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.
8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.
9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.
10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.
11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.
12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.
13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)
Disadvantages:
1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.
2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)
3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.
4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.
5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions.
6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.
7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game.
8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west.
9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4
Other things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:
1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out.
2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.
3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps.
4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system.
5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.
------------------------
Overall:
HOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people.
Personally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.

- Try to understand the Navy
- Give up on the Navy
- Carefully construct your armies
- After 5+ hours it is war time
- Enemy AI has infinite manpower and 2,000 planes in one region

"Every nationalist is haunted by the belief that the past can be altered. He spends part of his time in a fantasy world in which things happen as they should – in which, for example, the Spanish Armada was a success or the Russian Revolution was crushed in 1918 – and he will transfer fragments of this world to the history books whenever possible"

You're not going to know what the heck you're doing.
Keep playing.
You're going to get rekt from not knowing what you're doing.
Keep playing.
You're going to spend hours in the "tutorial" cursing Paradox and everybody who ever recommended this game to you.
Keep playing.
Even after about 330 hours I still have no idea what I'm doing sometimes. But as you learn each little piece of the game, bit by bit it will all start coming together and once those pieces start coming together, this will be your go to game for years to come.
The best advice I can give to any new player is to take some time to watch YouTube tutorials. There are thousands of tutorial videos on each aspect of the game and they will help you understand how things work much better than the in-game wiki.
Also, if at all possible, try to purchase this game while it and its DLCs are all on sale. The base game can get to feel a little bare bones once you get a grasp on the basics and the DLCs add a substantial amount to the overall package (especially Man the Guns).

This is my first review i have ever done and i felt like doing it because this game gave me something extraordinary.
Me(23 years old) and my dad who's 52 have always liked games. But for alot of the later years we simply did not play the same games. Probably because of taste. We did however, like strategy games both of us and have played alot of civilization together back in the times.
Now i fell over this game and i actually brought the game for both me and my dad so we could give it a go, for good old times sake. Little did i know what i got us into.
Together we figured out how the game work, step by step and getting stomped by the merciless AI's in every way possible for the first couple of hours. Please make a proper toturial for us casual people:(.
but nontheless we learned the basic of the game.
After 50 hours of insane amount of fun together with my father, which included long discussions of strategies, victories and defeats. Hell, we have even been sitting at the dinner table talking about in what ways we could bring down the russian bear.
Thank you for creating this amazing game and i would anytime recommend it for someone who got a friend og close relation to play it with. There's nothing bringing people together like taking over Europe.
10/10 would have my father as Hitler again.
UPDATE: After quite some years this game is still a thing that we pick up and play. Many hours of good fun to get if you have someone to play with and we did eventually bring down Russia quite a few times by now;)

Listen very carefully if you have like a job or in the middle of school do not play this game your time will be wasted. When having a game on Hoi4 your perception of time will drastically speed up and will cause you to have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up sleep scheduled or even hold a job. Addiction is real and this game is straight up Virtual cocaine the second you get addicted your relationships with loved ones and friends will cease to exist the second you load into a game. But if you have none of those then yeah go ahead

If you're planning to buy this game, I have to warn you.
Hearts of Iron IV will make you either a left/right wing extremist or the biggest femboy imaginable. There is no in between.

> The Spanish capitulate as I own ~80% of their cities but ~5% of their country's actual territory

Tl;Dr: I spent 500 hours making myself good enough at this game to show off to my friends, promptly almost lost in the most embarrassing way possible, then turned it around and made my friends wonder at my insane genius
And that is why I recommend this game.

I am a 38 y/o father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. Samuel got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with him, for he is always out with his friends or just watching people play on YouTube.
I had him create a Steam account for me, and purchased this title to see if I could perhaps play alongside him. I loaded into the game, chose my nation, and started playing, except I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked Samuel for help, and he hosted a multiplayer match so that I could join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since his mother passed away due to C-19. Hearts of Iron IV has since then, brought me and my adolescent son closer again, to the point he's found the enthusiasm to join me for fishing trips to our local lake. This purchase, albeit perhaps insignificant to some, has reminded me how there is fun to be had in video games despite my age. I just wish I had more time to play with him at home, though for now I'll settle for hotseat matches on his account; sometimes we argue about which focus tree to take next!

This is a bit hard to reccomend. The AI is a bit dumb, and will regularly leave it's front undefended, and when fighting alongside you, will never move thier units into a coherent fighting force. I played France in my own alliance, and after wiping Germany and the rest of the Axis, we warred with the Soviets, with America joining in. America kept most of it's units off the front, forcing my military to bear the brunt of a full soviet assault, which was very taxing on my manpower. Eventually won, but I'll be damned if America didn't have 10x my unit count, with most of them in my territory, and only about 10 divisions on the front. On the other hand, I find it fun. It's fun designing units, and devising strategies, and picking the right time to strike, and the right things to build at the right time.
That aside, Paradox has been very poor in it's decision making for the DLCs. The most recent, death or dishonor, honestly should've been a patch. They do the same thing for Stellaris, where MAJOR GAME CHANGES are kept behind a paywall. But, if Paradox pulls it's head out of it's butt, like many companies are doing slowly, than this may be one of the best grand strategy games ever. So I do recomend. Just expect to pay about $70 for the final product.
EDIT: The cornflakes free update has fixed many of the AI problems that where present. it still isn't the best at making intelligent decisions (such as communist China going to war with China AND Manchukuo after Japan had a civil war and went democratic), but it can at least wage war now. Front lines shift realistically, units get cut off, and will attempt to re-establish supply lines, and when backed into a corner, the AI won't just stuff 100 undersupllied units into 5 districts to try to keep it.

I don't leave reviews normally but I had to say something about this game. While I watched my dad die of cancer in hospital, this game was literally the only thing that kept me sane. We both loved history in particular WW2 history and this allowed me to feel a connection with the man and I'm truly grateful for that fact... With mods and constant updates, it's truly a unique game and probably my favorite game now.

Well, after spending enough time with this game I think I'm finally able to review it. If you're one of those people quickly scrolling through to get a general idea of wether or not you should buy, I reccomend it. If you want a more informed opinion, feel free to keep reading.
OVERVIEW:
Hearts of Iron IV is a "Grand Stratagy" game set during the turmoil of the 1930's/40's and the Second World War. You can command any nation around the world and lead it on to the world stage and on to glory. You must choose wether or not to begin playing in either 1936 or 1939. The former allows for a more custom setup and is better for playing small nations. If you're trigger-happy and eager to send millions of young men to their deaths, you can choose 1939, grab your gun and leap into the fray. No matter which country you command, you can customize it to your liking. You can change their ideology, strengthen their economy, and lead them to dominate the earth! You can create a fascist Finland, a communist Australia, or a democratic Venezuela (good luck with that one). You also have complete control over all armed forces of your nation, and you can practically do anything with them! If you wish to send hordes of unarmed men at the enemy's machine guns and trenches, you go right ahead. Now this game has many in's and out's that I could go on for hours about, but most of those things are easy to understand, and the internet exists for a reason! However, I will offer some advice to new players.
ADVICE TO THE PLEBS:
Good first-playthrough countries are Italy, Germany, the Soviet Union, or the United States.
Only make trade deals if you have no other choice-don't give away all your factories!
Remember to change the conscription laws when you are at war! You can do this by clickling on your country's flag and clicking on the conscription icon. "Quantity has a quality of it's own" -Joseph Stalin
Keep your fleets in port until you want to launch a naval invasion, then unleash them on the part of the sea you need to control in order to send transports through. By then your fleets should be large enough to hold off the enemy. This is especially true for Germany. The moment you send your fleet out, the entire Royal Navy will drop by for target practice and sink all of your ships. I know because it's happened to me.
Convoy Raiding is, admittedly, a joke in this game and it's not worth losing all of your submarines for.
Always make frontlines with your armies. Don't just deploy your men willy nilly, otherwise the enemy will break through quickly.
If you're the impatient sort and playing with a country that has a lot of resources, I reccomend the Mobile Warfare doctrine with some lovely Medium Tank divisions. Those guys can always win a war quickly.
Don't try to research everything.
If you plan on conquering a lot, research Military Police early on and assign them with cavalry, and put them on conquered states. You'll thank me later.
Now then, let's go over the overall pros and cons!
PROS and CONS
+Endless replayability
+Few restrictions on gameplay
+Land Warfare is (for the most part) simple enough to understand
+Division customization allows for custom armies
+The music is excellent
+Lots of opportunity for customization and creativity
+Fantastic modding community- Mods add hundreds more hours of playtime
+Mods and add pretty much anything you want into the game (Unit models, Music, ect.)
+You don't need any DLC for most mods, unlike other Paradox games
+Multiplayer is a good time
-Not enough natural resources, really annoying
-Naval combat is very hard to understand unless you're playing as Great Britain
-Naval combat is missing historical elements. It'll probably be fixed with a DLC, knowing Paradox
-The AI isn't perfect and can make some horrific strategic moves
-No coordination with ally AI on military stratagey
-Aerial combat, in it's current state, is simply throwing planes into the sky and seeing which side has more of them
-The treaty system has a lot of issues, but these can be fixed by the Player-Led Treaty mod and the State-Transfer mod
BEST PRO: The glorious feeling you get when you crush your enemies! Leading a country through WWII to victory is very satisfying and I believe the game has accomplished it's goal of bringing the grand strategy of the war into the player's control.
WORST CON: During the late game, most countries will have created hundreds of divisions. While this doesn't affect me that badly, it can cause a tremendous amount of lag and I've heard from several people that it has made their late-game saves unplayable. Paradox (or some modder) needs to implement a system in which the AI lessens the amount of divisions it has when it is at peace.
OVERALL RATING: 8/10
Though the game has it's faults and some aspects of it are difficult to understand, Hearts of Iron IV allows the player a thoroughly enjoyable experience for those who enjoy both History and Grand Stratagy. Now if you don't mind, I must return to my command tank and finish the conquest of Europe. Soon the entire world will tremble before the might of the fatherland! Achtung, Panzer!

Fun game, but Paradox's idea of a "base game" is literally the framework of a game, and then to make all the needed bits into "DLC".
I'm not paying $20 for new focus trees for tiny countries. I'm not paying $20 to literally have mechanics like espionage, which should be in the base game.
$6 just to hear voicelines during gameplay?
How about you make expansions, and not paywalls Paradox? This is sickening.
Posted: June 16, 2020
So. 1,000 hours of Hearts of Iron 4 later, and I still honestly don't know how I feel about this game. It's... an interesting experience, to say the least, there's certainly not many other games like it that I know of.
You want a TL:DR at the start? Sure, I can recommend this game, but that's with a very bit asterisk next to it.
To start with the pros, its definitely a very enjoyable game in the early stages of any match; the feeling of evaluating what you have to work with and then building up slowly in power, or starting off at a breakneck speed for some countries is spot on. The graphics, though a little rough at points are really great overall and do a wonderful job of conveying everything to the player. The menus, controls and UI, though complicated at first, are quick and efficient once you get them down. The sheer amount of variety in terms of playable countries (That is literally all of them) is also a big plus. Even though countries like Bhutan, Tibet or Nicaragua are dull as dirt once the novelty wears off, the sheer fact that the option is there is definitely commendable, as is the amount of branching and varied paths for each of the countries with a focus tree.
With that said, however, the game has plenty of flaws, foremost among them being the AI. It will either be the most formidable and downright unfairly impossible opponent to ever walk the Earth, or it will put up the resistance of a wet packet of spaghetti, and very rarely any level between that. Italy and the USSR are sorely lacking their updated focus trees, and whilst they are likely to come in a future DLC that doesn't change how dull they are to play currently unless you specifically want to play as Mussolini or Stalin, and whilst Italy tends to scrape by because of it's annoying navy and colonies, the USSR is almost a pushover at this point. Stalin can't ever seem to hold his territory and only ever seems to succeed when he's beating up countries twenty times smaller than his, and even then that's not a 100% for him. This makes trying to play any historical game a nightmare because he Nazi's, or just Germany in general are so absurdly powerful that they'll just steamroll the USSR without allowing for a truly historical game. Speaking of Germany, the fact that I never really set the AI to the fascist path anymore speaks to how annoyingly powerful they are; it's genuinely a disheartening time trying to have fun only to get run over by Germany's 600 suspiciously perfectly equipped divisions and 5,000 fighter planes (Not exaggerated numbers by any stretch) and then to end WW2 in an endless face-off between them and the Brits because the devs never programmed the German AI to know what a naval invasion is. The point of this is that often the AI becomes a roadblock to the player's fun, rather than a challenging opponent; Your allies sometimes become more of a pain than an comrade as their priorities are so messed up and incomprehensible that often you can find yourself thanking the random horde of Greek or Swedish troops holding your borders whilst wondering why the British abandoned Africa to the Italians, or the French leaving twelve guys, a box of wine and a cheese wheel to fend off seventy Italian divisions barrelling across the Alpes.
And then there's the DLC. Overall, have they greatly improved the gameplay and made things more immersive? Definitely. Should these parts of the game have been cut out and then sold back to you for an added fee? Hell no. Sure, one can argue that these were aspects the devs needed extra time to implement, or that they only thought of them later on, but that does not justify that in order to play Hearts of Iron 4 in any meaningful capacity beyond a basic WW2 sim, which by this point is one of the worse aspects of the game, you need to essentially pay for the game all over again and then some, which is just not acceptable to me.
So yes, overall I can say I can recommend this game for those who want a political or military wargame set in the 1930s and 40s, and who want to try interesting, unique or just plain silly alternate history options. But be very aware that the game only has so much content before you need to start relying on messing around with friends to keep it interesting, and make sure you're willing to buy at least some of the DLC, because otherwise you're not going to have much of a game to play.
Overall, a fairly solid 7/10 from me; a game whose pros are that it offers a unique wargaming situation in one of the most turbulent times in recent history, with plenty of interesting gameplay options and little intricacies even I'm still discovering, but whose cons are a predatory DLC system scooping out gameplay aspects to be sold back to the player and an AI who reaches Rome Total War 2 levels of bad more often than I would like to admit.
A true TL:DR? A WW2 sim that can be fun, but play only if you have no regard for your time or your wallet.

Let me tell you a story, a story about how a small and obscure nation, would come and rise to glory and ultimately shape history forever...
It is 1938 and the Munich Conference is in to discuss theSudeten crisis. France and the United Kingdom came to decide the fate of little Czechoslovakia's northern front, the Sudetenland. Both of these powerful nations, France and the U.K. decided to fall in to the German Reich's demands for the land, effectively giving it to them. But when the German soldiers went to their "newly aquired lands" they saw forts, bunkers and all sorts of fortifications along the border, with Czechoslovakian flags held high. See, the Czechs had a fear of this crisis since 1936, and they acted on it. They build great land forts, built the army, worked on moving to a full war economy and mass produced weapons. The Czechs were ready to defend their rightful home. 2 months will pass and the German Reich will demand that Czechoslovakia surrender the land or there will be war... The Czech president sent a message to the German aggressors, "Come and take it", at that moment, In 1938, the German Reich decalred war on the Czechs. No help from the U.K. or France made the situation look dire, but the brave Czechs had a plan, they reformed the "Little Enente" of Yugoslovia and Romania. Hungary, bordering the east of Czechslovakia would go onto join the Axis, and try to invade Slovakia, but Romanian troops will crush the Hungarian menace, and absorb their lands. Its now 1939 and Italy has not decided to enter the war, and Romanian and Yugoslavian troops occupied by fighting to defend Yugoslavia from German invasions, was unable to help the Czechs against Germany, Czechoslovakia stood alone. They saw the German army, the Panzers, the Luffwaffe, and decided that they must hold the line. Winter, 1939 German troops are suffering heavy from attrition, the Czechs have been prepared for winter and have plenty of equipment to hold, then, on December 17, 1939, the Field Marshall of the Czecholslovakian Army ordered a push to attack the encamped Germany attackers. The Czechs raided out of their bunkers and attacked the unprepared Germany army. The Germans were rapidly pushed back, Almost no rest for the retreating German army made them weak. January 12, 1940 -- The capital of the former nation Austria, Vienna, has been taken by Czech forces, the same will be with Nuremberg, Munich. March 11, All of former Austria has been taken by Czech forces, and the entire southern half of Germany has been taken. March 13, The Soviet Union will inavde Poland, and begin to justify war against the Czechoslovakian goverment. In March 27, 1940, the capital of the German Reich, Berlin, will fall to Czech forces, Germany is contemplating surrender. A day later, March 28th, Italy will decide it cannont stand idely by while their ally is being demolished, they declare war on Czechoslovakia. Italy will launch a full invasion on Yugoslavia, in April, Yugoslavia will capitulate to the Italians. Every bit of Germany has been taken except the city of Hamburg, the last bastion of the Nazi goverement. In September of 1940, the German Reich will capitulate to Czech troops. Italy stands alone against the Czech might, A massive army pushed down the Italian pennisula and in December of 1940, Rome will fall. In Early 1941, Italy will surrender to Czech forces, and will be left with control only over Sicily and Sardina, effectively kicked off mainland Europe. In March of 1941, Japan will enter the war and attempt to restore the GErman Reich, their invasion will be stopped. In May, 1941, Japan will give up on the war and ask for peace. The Allies are fighting against Comintern forces while the Czechs consolidate their newly aquired land of Germany, Austria and Italy... and remember the day that when their freedom was in danger, they fought, fought valiantly for it, and won.
The course of human history was changed that day, WW2 never occured, America and the Allies will fight and destory the Soviet Union in late 1944, the Cold War will never happen, and Czechoslovakia will become one of the most powerful nations in the world. Czechmate.
15/15 Would change history again
