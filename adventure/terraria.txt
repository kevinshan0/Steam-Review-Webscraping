Terraria's latest major update, Journey's End (1.4) Labor of Love (1.4.4) is here. And it's great! I'll explain to all of you why I recommend Terraria. You should get this game right now since the game is essentially complete and is full of content (and thanks for all the feedback on my review! It's much appreciated).
Intro:
If I were to explain Terraria to someone quickly, I would put it like this: Terraria is a game that has a whole world to explore. You mine, build, craft, fish, and fight to progress through the game. You can focus on fighting enemies and improving your gear to fight various bosses, and/or you can focus on building your house and buildings and making things look pretty. Terraria has something for everyone. The combination of survival, fighting, exploration, and building aspects is satisfying (and I'm someone who usually plays shooter games). So I believe that you can find something in Terraria for you.
Building:
When Re-Logic added half blocks and slanted blocks to Terraria in 1.2, the building got so much more interesting and versatile. There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and styles, and with paint there are even more possibilities. So many creations made in this game are incredibly good.
Difficulty:
Overall, Terraria with a Classic (AKA Softcore) character and Classic (AKA Normal Mode) world is not that hard, but just be aware that no matter what, you’ll probably die a lot as a beginner. If you like a challenge, however, Expert Mode is the way to go (plus you get extra advantages, such as exclusive accessories, for having an increased difficulty). Even more difficult is Master Mode, giving you more loot than Expert Mode. And if you want the game to be especially difficult, you could create a Mediumcore character (drop all items on death), Hardcore character (permadeath), or use a world seed such as For the worthy. There is also Journey Mode, which is an adjustable difficulty semi-creative mode that requires a Journey exclusive character (can’t go to Classic, Expert Mode, or Master Mode worlds). Personally, I think playing a Classic character in Expert Mode is the most fun way to play.
Music:
Terraria’s music is great. All of it fits with the style of the game. Almost every biome has a unique song to fit with the theme, and there are different songs for bosses and events as well. I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background music.
Multiplayer:
Multiplayer is incredibly easy to set up. The easiest way to play is to join/host through Steam. You can also enter an IP address, which, before 1.3, used to be the only way to play multiplayer at all, but now it's so much easier with Steam integration.
Connection is rarely a problem for me, although I think I’ve found that the host has worse lag than the other players, when there is lag that is.
Terraria is very fun to play with friends and even with strangers. There are teaming options, PVP, and other multiplayer elements built into the game. Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as well, because usually if one player dies, the other player(s) can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawn.
Performance:
Terraria runs very well. On my gaming PC, the game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds. On my over a decade old Toshiba laptop, the game runs very nicely on low settings, with only minor loading times.
There are several video settings that can be modified to help performance. I would recommend at least turning the background and effects off for lower-end computers.
Price:
Terraria is very inexpensive. It’s one of the few games I’ve bought at full price and found it completely worth it.
Struggles:
Terraria has a learning curve. There are many things left up to you to figure out from the start. The Guide NPC is there to give some help. Many things, however, are left up to the player to figure out, much of which is just learned through time and experience. I would recommend looking up tips, tricks, and other information online, such as on the Official Terraria Wiki, or watch videos, like those of ChippyGaming and Edward on YouTube. Personally, I enjoy the learning curve, and the struggle to learn new things is just the right amount to be enjoyable and not annoying.
To get to the endgame of Terraria, it does take a while. There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terraria, that it can be overwhelming, and progression can sometimes feel slow. You may want to rush things like bosses, but you have to prepare well for bosses, or else you’ll probably die. I used to ragequit when I couldn’t beat bosses, and I still get frustrated if I can’t beat a boss. Once you defeat bosses, however, it feels so worth it. And you don’t have to follow an exactly linear path either. Also, you don’t have to play for 30+ hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished. From one to a million hours, this game is fun for any length of time.
My biggest struggle with this game is the grind for certain items. Some items are extremely hard to get, due to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances. There are many items with a drop chance lower than 1%. Realistically, you won’t get every item in the game, if that’s what you’re aiming for. I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game (you have to kill 50 of the same enemy to get a banner) legitimately, but I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 50 of each enemy for the rarest ones (that darn Nymph Banner). To put it simply, it’s possible to get every item in the game, but it’s just not worth it. You should, however, build farms for certain items. But the point is, just get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimately, and it’ll be worth it (if you did want every single item in the game, you can use inventory editors or go to free item servers, but it’s not fun to abuse these).
Tips:
* Organize and name chests ASAP
* Place rope down a Hellevator
* Coral Torches are waterproof and Cursed/Ichor Torches (craftable in Hardmode) are liquidproof, making them ideal for being placed on bridges and Hellevators
* The Smart Cursor, toggled on or off using Left Ctrl by default, is extremely useful for digging straight tunnels, building structures such as bridges, removing large areas of walls, and other functions. However, don't forget to toggle it off when you're not using it since things can go out of control
* Look up how to maintain world purity, since the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow biomes spread across the world, and the Corruption/Crimson can infect the Jungle biome over time
* Go fishing. It’s worth it. Fishing gives you so many tools, accessories, and other loot that enhance the game tremendously. Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the world, use him to get quests to find a specific fish, which you can redeem for loot
* For making potions, use an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 1 in 3 chance to not consume potion ingredients
* Use Invisibility Potions while farming for Truffle Worms
* Use Warmth Potions while fighting cold/ice-themed enemies (Deerclops, Frost Moon, etc.)
Conclusion:
I've played this game for over a decade now. I made a Steam account for this game, and I've played through so much of the game's development back when there wasn't even a fraction of the number of items in the game. To put it simply, Terraria is my favorite game. So after well over a thousand hours of playtime, I can safely say that I 100% recommend buying and playing Terraria.

I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.
Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further.
Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime.
After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on.
With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.
I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me.
Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors.
Sincerely,
Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen

You feel an evil presence watching you...
This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end.
Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health.
My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected.
Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...
All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game.
Fortune and glory kid...

After playing the game since 2011 I have just realized I have never left a review.
Well...
I have pirated the game and then I have bought game several times for myself, and several times as a gift for others.
I have played the game solo, with friends, with my girlfriend and planning to introduce it to my daughters (who were born since the game launched).
I have spent hundreds of hours on 1.0... hundreds of hours on 1.1... on 1.2... on 1.3... and planning to spend hundreds more on 1.4.
I have built, fought, explored, created wild-life reservation worlds as well as apocalyptic wastelands...
So I guess, it's not that bad game after all.
Posted: May 28, 2017
Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ... When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10
Posted: December 24, 2018
So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria:
- This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements
- It has an incredible amount of content to it
- Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class)
- Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy
- A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight
- Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now)
- Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped!
- Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore!
- I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTING
Cons? Hmm.
- Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized!
- Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though.
- Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.
- Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game.
Other thought:
- If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.
Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):
I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.
Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.
There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is.
I spent $10 on this.

For everyone saying this is a 2D Minecraft, you're wrong. This game has a lot of stuff to offer. Different kind of bosses, unique items, an adventure u WILL NEVER forget, Terraria.

Labor of love from this developer is unreal.
Free update after free update for several years, and now here we are at "The Journey's End" update.
So much content to play, Huge replay value / replayability.
If you like sandbox, base building, RPG, or you are a creative person definitely recommend this game.
9.5 / 10
Posted: January 19, 2021
10 years of active development, 0 DLC, 0 microtransactions, a consistent $10 price tag with consistent 50% markdowns during any and all major steam sales.
Enough about the developers and marketing, lets talk about the game.
Amazing replayability, gameplay variety, length, and sense of consistent progression. The game has one of the best communities of any game I have ever played. Not to mention modding is now supported on steam (see Tmodloader) and the modding community is actually CRACKED.
I recommend everyone and their mother plays Terraria. Buy it.

The Best Game
Posted: November 27, 2019
How have I not written a review for this amazing game?
I've been playing Terraria ever since the days of early 1.1.1, in the Christmas season of 2011. Over these years, I've logged just about 2000 hours total, along with another 1000 hours played offline. Enough showing off though. Why in the world should you buy this game?
Terraria is an experience where you're given basically unlimited liberty. Even before you start, you get to completely customize your character and world. After setting it all up, you get dropped into the center of the overworld, where you can go off to do whatever you want. For those of you who got bored with Minecraft as I did, don't worry, as Terraria completely fixes that problem with branching pathways in weapon classes and self-imposed challenges.
You can even get a vastly different experience, cooperating with friends on an extremely easy to-set-up multiplayer server. By hosting directly through Steam, you just open up your world from the Multiplayer menu, and send an invite to your friend(s)! It's that easy! No need for messy port-forwarding or separate third party accounts!
If your class specific challenges and multiplayer options can't fill your needs, there are tons of really great mods to check out! Thorium and Calamity are 2 of the biggest ones out there. Thorium blends and balances perfectly with the base game's progression, while Calamity adds some incredibly difficult boss battles and other challenges in higher levels than the progression of the base game (or so I've heard... I'm still blind to most of it). Separately, those 2 add so much on their own, but there are so many others that can change so many things about the game. Possibilities are endless when it comes to modding in Terraria.
Back to the base game, the music is absolutely outstanding, and along with the ambient noises, the game has an amazing sense of atmosphere. Evil places feel like they're filled with dark energy and horrible power. Underground caverns are filled with anxiety of incoming danger and hope to find loot. The list goes on...
Bosses can be difficult to fight (especially in Expert, and soon, in Master Mode), but the weapons and abilities that you can obtain in Terraria simply make you feel amazing, each one having its own uses. The controls are entirely customizable, even allowing for extra mouse buttons to be used (if you have any), and they're extremely tight. I can't say I've ever seen a more fun grappling hook mechanic than the one in Terraria. It's like a 360 degree hookshot, and the physics feel absolutely perfect on it. There's no better feeling than grappling onto a block and releasing the hook (jumping) early to launch yourself with some huge momentum (then, if you're like me, doing it again immediately in the opposite direction, and repeating). Mobility might be really slow, and to be honest, a bit boring at the start of the game (in Normal Mode, at least), but it greatly improves as you make progress.
Lastly, the Terraria community is one of the best out there. So many helpful folks are in the official Discord Server, if you ever have any questions that the Guide NPC or the thoroughly in-depth wiki site can't answer. There are many things I didn't cover here, but I don't have time to go into every reason why I love this game, and I doubt you have much more time to keep reading them anyways. ;P
Sorry, my train of thought can sometimes go off the rails. Thanks for your time reading this far, and I hope this review was helpful! Hope to see you around in the community! :D
TLDR;
This is an utterly fantastic game. Do yourself a favor, and buy it.
Posted: November 21, 2021
[TL;DR]
* Terraria is a highly replayable sandbox RPG and it is fun whether played alone or with friends.
Gameplay:
+ Progress through the game by defeating bosses.
+ Defeating bosses unlocks new content.
+ High player agency, play and progress however you want, at whatever pace you like.
Content:
+ Contains over 4000 ITEMS in the game to find and play around with, varying from cosmetics to functional equipment and fun silly toys ensuring that every playthrough feel unique.
+ Not repetitive, it's fun and fresh even after completing it several times.
+ Offers both a casual experience for casual players and a challenging one for hardcore players.
+ Only 200mb for hundreds of hours worth of content. (Even more if you like to min max stuff)
[AND NOW, AN ESSAY FOR YOU WEIRDOS THAT LIKE TO READ] (like m-me)
* (note: heavily based on my experience, your experience may differ according to your own personal preferences)
[Overview]
* I'm fairly casual in comparison to other more hardcore players. I stop playing for a few months after a session or two, but every time I touch this game again (usually on a whim) I just fall in love with it all over again despite having completely finished it several times already. Something about this game just feels really satisfying to play and every time i touch it, I was met with an incredibly pleasant experience (even though i die and fail a lot).
* Although, for complete beginners, the game is really easy to drop when you first touch it (I know since I dropped it when i first got the game) since you're not entirely sure what to expect, but take your time to learn the basics and do some wiki lurking here and there when you're stuck and you'd find that the game goes much deeper and offers an incredibly rich experience than you'd first expected (I know it did for me).
[The Game]
* Game flow fundamentally revolves around defeating bosses. You make preparations for boss battles which when defeated, unlocks more options for you to play around with to prepare for the next boss you set your sight on, progressively making you stronger but also changing the world around you, introducing something new with each boss defeated whether that be new equipment, or entirely new areas of the world.
* Often times defeating a boss once won't give you everything you want, so you will occasionally find yourself killing a boss twice or thrice. Although, if you prefer, you can do them only once and move on which would be as equally viable as slapping them over and over until you have everything they can possibly drop for you (although it might be bad for the bosses' own mental health).
[The Experience]
* Terraria doesn't particularly demand you to play it in any specific way. You can play it in any way you prefer and at the pacing you wish to play in. It gives you a goal and challenges you but doesn't confine you to just a single exit, instead it gives you hundreds of tools to play and tinker around with in how you approach the obstacles the game presented to you.
* The amount of diversity in the way you can progress and complete this game in is outstanding. My experience in the game didn't feel predictable nor repetitive despite the game having clear checkpoints (the bosses) and a limited world (literally just an island). Despite always having the same biomes guaranteed to spawn in a world, each experience feel new and being acquainted with them does not make the experience bland but instead enriching it since the way you interact with your environment matters, making me feel rewarded the more I know and understand.
* It also helps that all content in the game whether it be building, mining, farming, exploring or just good old murder of local wildlife weaves back into the core game progression seamlessly without ever feeling out of place, making it easy to get immersed with the game. Thanks to this it does not confine you to any kind of play style, you may progress through the game however you want to, but it also does not discourage or punish you for straying off from the core progression.
[Conclusion]
* Its a good game, give it a chance and take your time getting used to it. Don't shy away from the wiki if you feel like you're really stuck or unsure what to do next. If you're not feeling like a hardcore masochist the game also offers a much more relaxed experience through Journey mode characters so try that if you're a really casual player. Fine tune the experience to the experience you're looking for and you'll find yourself in an incredibly pleasant experience (that also involves a lot of dying, but you'll get used to it)
So basically,
What i want to say is, this game is fun and i love it
I recommend it if you're bored
I spent 2 hours writing this
Its 3 AM
How'd this happen
Posted: June 2, 2017
I have played this game for 1,055 hours at the time of writing.
This is an amazing game. It's ability to make people gravitate back to it after an update is very nice. Speaking of updates, the developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time. I really recommend this game for mainly two reasons, it has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again. The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world. From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple times, it is a fun game. But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition. Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friends, I just can't stop playing. I really recommend this game, it is definitely worth the 10 dollars.
EDIT: 1000 hours later re-review (2,123 hours at the time of edit)
This game STILL stands as one of the best games I've played to date.
Journey's End (update 1.4) was a great update, although it didn't change much in the way of over-all game progression, it revamped and/or added to many of the lackluster parts of the game, (ex: bloodmoon fishing, town rework, new mushroom biomes, summoning rework, etc). There was also variety of balancing changes that were introduced with 1.4, which I believe were for the better. Some staple items were nerfed, but still very good. On the other hand, a lot of niche/"bad" items were reworked or buffed, making them on par (or better) compared to many other items.
It would also be a crime to not mention the modding scene for this game. If you buy this game, do yourself a favor and download tModLoader off of steam, because oh my, there are a lot of great mods out there. Keep in mind that tModLoader isn't 1.4 (yet), but is still a massive blast and a great experience.
Some mods I would heavily recommend are:
Split
This mod is my favorite so far, prioritizing quality over content. Everything in this mod is
very well made.
Calamity
The most popular mod by far, has an AMAZING soundtrack composed by DMDokuro,
definitely check out their other work. (and don't forget the music is a separate mod!)
Play this mod on expert mode with revengeance rune active for the intended experience!
Thorium
This mod adds a musical bard class that buffs you and your allies, so definitely play this
one with a squad for the best experience.
Fargo's mods
This group of mods adds an 'eternity mode' that will truly unleash hell upon your world,
and I don't mean more health and damage for enemies, I'm talking unique mechanics.
Changes to all of the bosses AI and some normal enemy AI makes them feel fresh again,
the enchantment accessories you can make, and 3 town npcs that you fight as bosses
later on (they are seriously well done). You will die a lot, so have patience.
Terraria Overhaul
This mod doesn't add much in the way of items or bosses at all, however, it will make
Terraria a much different experience. You might not like a lot of what this mod has to offer,
and a lot of mechanics can be disabled in the settings, but at least give it a try.
Polarities
Polarities is sadly a mod that only works in singleplayer, but what it has to offer in return is
an amazing experience. New biomes, bosses, enemies, items, a few new mechanics, and
another dimension you can travel to (that can lead to some very interesting sequence
breaking in terms of progression), there is a lot this mod has to offer. Definitely give it a try.
and do not forget to get a variety of QoL mods to help you out (1.4 doors, boss checklist, etc.)
Edit 2: more mods to check out (i'll add descriptions later)! (Vanilla hours: 2262; TModloader Hours: 462+ however many i had before it went on steam)
Spirit
Shadows of Abaddon
Mod of Redemption
Elements Awoken
The Stars Above
Gensokyo (Touhou mod, music addon also has remixes cuz copyright)
Starlight River Demo (cool ass looking mod in development, definitely check out the demo)
Dragon Ball Terraria (i have never watched dragonball in my life but this mod was kinda fun)

This is most likely the only review I will ever do for a game, and I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate. I have played this game for just under 600 hours (Online) and countless more offline, as well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours. 6 years ago, I asked my cousin if I could buy a game. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. It was dirt cheap, 10 US dollars at the time, which is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this game, as well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans. Waiting for it to download, I was ecstatic. The art style was cool and retro, and the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to time, ripe for the picking. Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world. I couldn’t wait to get my grubby little hands on it. From the moment I booted up the game, the music and visuals instantly invigorated me. It felt so cool to create your own character, so many different styles and colours, so many choices and personalization’s you could do. I spent around 5 minutes creating my first character, and after that, I was set out into a mysterious world, filled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice. My first night is one I will never forget. Armed with shuriken’s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hill, I had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead. They were coming at me from every direction, and with demon eyes flying overhead, death was inevitable.
As soon as I respawned, my gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in. Eventually, we held off the masses and dawn finally came. I had realized that I needed a house to stay in, and that’s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of any games I have played; the building.
There are so sososososososo many blocks to build, hammer and axe together in intuitive, creative and interesting ways. The early days were not the best for building, as the textures were quite pixelated and low quality. But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better. The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing builds, and it only got better with each update. There was sloping blocks, paint, different walls, how each block melded together, how each block interacted with other blocks, the light sources, the different platforms that you could use. All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build. This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platform.
After I was done building my house, I set out to find more loot to plunder. That’s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly. Normal mode was a bit too easy for me, so the combat was less punishing then I’d like it to be, but the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes. Everything about the combat is satisfying, even hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying. And it only got better from there. The progression is done immaculately, precariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which way, you have to be on your toes at all time. Just when you think you’ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of fire, the game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you. And you cannot wait to get back into it.
The gameplay loop is a satisfying composition of combat, farming and building. Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress. Building houses? More NPC’s to trade with. Want herbs? You got potions to buff you with. Fishing? Boom, rare items that could (RIP Reaver shark) catapult your progress into the future, skipping entire phases of the game. Speaking of phases of the game, it has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements. Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the last, and it keeps pushing you forward, to the point of not stopping. I remember trying to farm for a rare item (Turtle Shells) for 14 hours straight, and I only got 1. I did other stuff in between, sure, but the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses. As well as being incredibly challenging and rewarding, it is peaceful at times.
With the Journeys end update, the new music added a whole new layer immersion. I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftop, listening to the songs and watching my NPC’s just walk around and chat. There is so much to do in this game, its not just combat oriented. And all of this is just in single player! The game has so much support for its community, from steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour. It is a fantastic game, and I could not recommend it more.
I absolutely adore this game, and it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years. My words could never do it justice, even though I hope to describe even a fraction of what this game has been to me.
Thanks for reading 😊

Every steam library needs Terraria

What could I possibly say? You don't spend 900 hours in a 10 dollar game if it sucks.

Absolutely phenomenal game, thousands of hours of playtime, difficulties for all people and a unique experience that leaves you feeling godlike and powerful for every second you play.
One of my all time favourites, a game done right, made with love, and overall deserving of the praise it receives. Modding community is huge, and provides even more hours of entertainment on top of the base game.
GET THIS GAME, no questions asked.

Terraria is one of the top rated games on steam. And honestly, it deserves it. I think this is a damn good game. I won’t say it’s a perfect game and there are certainly some things you should know before you buy it, but I will happily give it a recommend.
Let Me Begin with What the Game is About and What Makes it Cool. You start out with a basic sword, axe, and pickaxe, in the middle of nowhere. You’re first step is to get wood and build a shelter to protect you from the zombies at night. Next you need to dig down and get ore to make better gear. So it’s 2d minecraft? Well it’s more than that, let me continue. You’ll need decent armor and weapons to fight the tougher monsters that live underground and to fight bosses.
Yep bosses. Bosses are one of the defining elements of this game. Bosses are big and imposing and they play this awesome adrenaline music when you summon them (a lot of the Terraria music is awesome btw). And there’s a huge variety of bosses too: There’s a floating eye that aggressively charges at you, there’s a big worm creature that breaks into smaller worms as you damage it, there’s an angry plant that can only be fought in the claustrophobic jungle, there’s a cult leader that summons mirages of itself and makes the game into a bullet hell with how many projectiles it spits out. Now bosses can be very punishing, but this is a building/crafting game, so you can build your own arena with platforms to jump on and walls to protect you from (some) attacks, or craft potions that boost your speed, health regen, armor, and damage. The fact that you can tackle bosses on your own terms in your own arena is one of the most interesting parts of the game and it really makes boss fights feel epic.
Killing bosses is the main way you progress through the game. Killing them gives you some kickass loot or lets you access a parts of the world where you can discover some more kickass loot. There’s a lot of loot in this game. And it’s some pretty cool loot too. You get staffs that call meteors down from the sky, fireball staffs, swords that shoot fireballs, machine guns, rocket launchers, different kinds of ammo to go in your guns, yo-yo’s (yo-yos are a really cool weapon), boomerangs, tools that summon monsters or turrets to fight for you, tools that let you jump real high (useful for dodging boss attacks), vehicles that let you move real fast, grappling hooks for going spelunking. The more bosses you kill and the further you progress, the more powerful and interesting the loot you get. Seriously, getting new loot just feels absolutely wonderful in this game.
So yeah, I would say mining, boss fighting, and collecting loot are the meat of the game, but there’s plenty of gravy too. Maybe you want to take a break from boss fighting and do some fishing so you can get a chainsaw fish and also some potion ingredients. Well then you probably want to create a few ponds throughout your world. And you’ll probably want to set up some minecart tracks or teleporters to get to your ponds quickly. Or maybe you want to set up a mushroom farm because mushroom are good for potions as well as crafting some late game armor. Well you’ll want to create several rows of dirt so the mushrooms have plenty of surface area to spawn on. And if you don’t want to harvest mushrooms manually you can set up a bunch of conveyor belts and wire so the mushrooms just fall down and come to you. Or maybe a part of your world is corrupt. Corruption spreads slowly so you may want to dig a trench around it to keep it quarantined, or you can buy a special gun that cleanses corruption outright. Or maybe you need a bunch of unicorn horns. You could go to the part of the world where unicorns spawn and kill them with your flaming yo-yo. Or you could dig a big pit and every time a unicorn come by it falls into the pit and dies because the pit is full of lava and spiky traps. This is a crafting game where enemies are just another crafting resource, so setting up a death pit to farm unicorns is a logical thing to do. There’s plenty of stuff to do in Terraria and plenty of ways to do it.
And Now for the Parts of the Game You Might Not Find so Cool. First of all, the difficulty. Specifically, the bosses. Bosses will kill you. Bosses are tough. You can give yourself boosts with potions and armor, but dodging attacks is your best bet. And that can be very difficult when the boss charges rapidly at you or shoots a dozen balls of lightning at you. You will need to learn the attack patterns of bosses and you will need to train your reflexes. I mentioned bullet hell earlier, and I really do think this game has bullet hell elements. If you just can’t stand bullet hell games you probably want to avoid Terraria. (Since difficulty is a pretty subjective thing, you may want to look up a video review of Terraria and see some boss fights and combat for yourself.)
Another thing I want to mention is the sheer amount of stuff to learn. You should be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Terraria wiki. It’s a crafting game, so you’ll need to look up crafting recipes as well as how to get ingredients. It’s also a game about fighting giant bosses, so you’ll need to know how to summon bosses and you’ll probably want to read some tips on making an arena. If you want to build a garden or fishing pond you’ll want to know when certain herbs bloom and how much water to put in your pond. For building more complex structures, you may want to look up tutorials on youtube (the game has gone through several updates though, so some youtube tutorials are out of date). Personally, I kinda enjoyed learning the game. I’d get some weird item in my inventory and immediately going to the wiki to see what I could do with it. But I realize not everyone wants to study a wiki while they play video games.
One of the interesting parts of the game is how it’s a building/fighting hybrid kind of game. And while that’s cool some of the time, it can be really annoying at other times. Say you’re underground building an arena to fight a boss, then a bat flies out at you, now you have to stop building and take out your weapon. So you kill the bat and try to get back to building, but another bat spawns and you have to kill that one too. The game literally has a formula where if it detects there aren’t any enemies near you it will spawn new enemies, so you will constantly have to fight off annoying enemies while you’re trying to build or mine. (I should mention that there are tools that help deal with enemy harassment, but you need to know how to get them, which reinforces my point that you need to read the wiki)
I don’t really like Terraria’s endgame. Most of the early and midgame consists of exploring, building, and crafting, with the occasional action-packed boss fight thrown in, which I like because it offers some nice variety. However the endgame is back-to-back combat. Fight a boss, then fight a bunch of minibosses, then fight another boss, then fight four living towers which spawn very fast very dangerous enemies, then fight another boss. For my first playthrough of this game I stopped playing when I got to the endgame because I just didn’t want to slog through all the fighting. Now, I actually like the combat and I liked fighting bosses throughout the game, but it’s a simple combat system and fighting loses some of its charm when you do it for too long.
So this review turned out longer than I expected. I guess I wanted to be thorough. When I first played this game I got pretty frustrated at times and I was prepared to toss out the game altogether. But then I got into it a bit more and learned the mechanics better and I actually really liked it. Despite its flaws, this is probably one of my favorite games ever.

I grew up playing this game pretty much, it's what got me into PC gaming in general. I learned it inside and out. I seriously love this game to death. If you're considering it, it's completely and utterly worth the buy. 11/10

spawn in, talk to the videogame equivalent of wikipedia, kill slimes and cut trees. fight a floating eyeball, a huge worm, and a giant skeleton. loot a religious gravesite and arm yourself with a lightsaber and a machinegun-shark. then go to hell and fight a wall of flesh that shoots lasers. build a wooden commie block for npcs like an enviromentalist, a furry or a terrorist. fight floating eyeball, huge worm, and giant skeleton again, but this time they're made of metal and shoot lasers. kill a giant plant and terrorize an ancient underground civilization to summon their guardian diety. survive an invasion from goblins, pirates, aliens, and 20th century classic horror movie monsters. go back to religious gravesite and murder all its followers, then fight their priest. arm yourself with a nyan cat sword and a machinegun-dolphin and fight off a galactic invasion, then kill the god of the universe.
repeat for 1000+ hours, 10/10 one of the best videogames of all time

Most likely, my review will remain in the shadows, and hardly anyone will reach the end of my review, I still want to share with you my feelings and the seasoned spirit of adventure. It all started many years ago, when I got acquainted with one of the most wonderful, warm, and memorable games in my life - Terraria. When pronouncing this word, I immediately feel warm in my soul, I remember the wonderful soundtrack and completely immerse myself in my thoughts. Before reviewing, I immediately want to note that this game gave me a new perception of computer games, and gave me a great childhood.
I myself am not an ordinary player in Terraria, and there are few such oldies, because I got acquainted with Terraria even before its release, or more precisely, before the official release of the game on Steam (May 16, 2011). And although I have played 200 hours of this game in my Steam, I actually played it for about 1000 hours. When I was little, I, like all children, played Minecraft, and I really liked this game, I thought that I could not find a better game. But one fine day, my dad came home from work and told me about Terraria, which just appeared. Another employee told Dad about the game, and another employee told this employee, and then I don't know the story of the spread of rumors about a brand new freshly baked Terraria. When I first started the game, I created my character, spending several hours on it, pressed the button to create a world, and found myself on the ground. Someone walked next to me, his name was Guide, who first fell into the abyss ... I don't know why he did it, but it didn't really bother me. The first thing I learned was how to walk, jump and dig, and it was incredibly fun! After that I dug a hole for myself, buried myself on top and went to play Minecraft ... Don't judge strictly, but for a child then Minecraft was much more colorful, and had a 3D view, and not a cropped 3D space along the Z axis. But a couple of days later I went back in into the game, and again continued to explore the world, the game did not cause as much enthusiasm for me as many people who have started playing quite recently. And I don't know if it's good that I started playing such a raw game. But as time went on, I studied the world of Terraria more and more. I got to know cute teardrop-mongers and creatures that were constantly killing me. I realized that I needed a home to live, and that's when I discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of all the games I've played - building. So I gave up traveling and started BUILDING and DIGGING! And then this game completely sucked me in. I quit Minecraft and started DIGGING, KILLING, AND EXPLORING. I met new residents who can SELL! And a nurse who can CHOOSE! I also realized that the Guide is not a useless piece of garbage, and that you can have a heart-to-heart talk with him. In the end, I killed the ominous Eye of Cthulhu, which sowed fear, and the game ended there ... But soon new updates came out, I downloaded new versions and went all over again. And it was interesting. I went through each update, and did not get a mental pleasure. Since I like everything more difficult, I started playing the game on the Expert Advisor, and later on the Master. But all this was not enough for me! And I started to go through mods, for those who know Calamity mod, I went through this game with Revenge and Death modes, and also after a few hundred attempts I went through Boss Rush. Then I lost my nerves.
With each update, the game brought new emotions and a colorful world to the players and me. Every progress you make is much more satisfying than the last one and continues to push you forward, to the point where you don't stop. There is no point in talking about old versions, so I'll tell you a couple (hundreds) of words about the new Terraria.
For me this game became a home in which I felt comfortable. The game is currently in the game about 500 varieties of mobs. There are also 19 bosses and 13 mini-bosses, as well as 3 additional bosses in the mobile version. And from listing recipes you can break your tongue. Sloped blocks, paints, different walls were added to the game, each block merged together, each block interacted with other blocks. Light sources, different platforms that you may have used. All of this and more meant that anything imaginable could be built. Many people create amazing mechanisms and worlds, better than on paper!) Although they made a convenient interface for creating my character in the game, I also devote a lot of time to creating a character). And the music and style of play makes me crazy. I bought this game for my every account, and made all my friends, no matter if it was voluntary, to purchase this masterpiece. And if you are thinking whether to buy this game, I can hardly answer you ... YES !!! This game is amazing both solo and when playing with friends! You can catch hares and then fill the whole world of your friend with them! It's worth buying for this!
I can confidently say that Terraria has become my corner of safety, this is my home, there is no place easier and quieter than it.

This is my 'Go to' game for a bit of action and creative planning. It's very relaxing to just take care of your world, and if you want some excitement, there are plenty of enemies lurking above as well as below ground. If you haven't played Terraria yet, give it a shot. I think you'll find hours of entertainment in this classic masterpiece. So far, I've played nearly 5000 hours and I still love it! Cheers

This review applies to Terraria 1.3.0.8 and earlier.
The essence of Terraria is that it prioritizes fun! It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.
Pros
Customization: There is a staggering amount of customization available in-game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors, costumes, accessories, and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable, so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage.
Exploration: The Terraria world may be finite, but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see "The Creation of the Guide" painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the Terraria world, you discover something surprising.
Creativity: Terraria is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors. Terraria features innovative design at its finest.
Progression options: Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult.
You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently had too many options and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive.
Balance: A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into. Terraria manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress.
Diversity: Terraria promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone.
I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible.
Automation: Terraria would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores.
Performance: Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements. Terraria is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*Starbound*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy Terraria in its full glory.
Quality of life: Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is Terraria's gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface.
Continued updates: It would be very easy for Terraria, as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.
Cons
New player friendliness: The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in Terraria's sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game.
Grinding: While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet Terraria is not above this issue.
Moddability: Terraria is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay.

97% Positive over 13 years. Literally nothing is bad about this game. A must play for RPG lovers.
(NO it's not 2D Minecraft.)
Posted: June 29, 2021
LITERALLY ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME.
Posted: October 3, 2020
💻/📱 Description:
Terraria is among the BEST if not the best game of this decade, which surprises me considering its very low price. The content is beyond overwhelming with many bosses, challenges and options that you won’t ever get bored of. The game revolves around you the player, as the difficulty and gameplay change depending upon your progression. The art style and music are very exceptional, bringing us the fanbase pleasant memories even to this day.
📖 Setting:
Summary
Terraria is a land full of mystery and wonder. You the adventure are given the task to cleanse this magical world from the spreading cancer called Hollow/Corruption. Many powerful beings will stand in your way, so grab some loot, find allies and restore the balance. Since many players forget the fact that Terraria includes a story in the first place. I suggest you read the lore from the Wiki [terraria.gamepedia.com] to get accustomed to the plot.
🕹️ Gameplay:
Terraria refers to casual and hardcore players alike. You can slay forces or start creating buildings, without though being obliged to do so. The game offers a variety of blocks and items that encourage creativity. You can even build your mini-golf park! The goal here is to have fun and not just constantly grind for loot.
Difficulty
The actual Difficulty mode is a character set selected during character creation. There are 5 types of difficulty: Softcore, Mediumcore, Hardcore and the newly added Journey mode that can only be played on journey worlds. All the above-mentioned modes change the penalty upon death.
Description	Difficulty
Characters start with extra equipment	Journey
Characters drop coins upon death	Classic
Characters drop items on death	Mediumcore
Characters cannot respawn!!	Hardcore
Another form of difficulty is world modes. Those are separate settings that apply to the world, rather than the character. Players may choose between Journey, Classic, Expert, and Master mode when creating a new seed. Each mode provides more loot, as well as special accessories depending on the difficulty you have chosen. I advise new players to start with the Classic mode, as Expert and Master are very demanding for a novice adventurer.
Hapiness 
Community Created Artwork for Steam Artwork
By: Majordomo
NPCs are not lifeless things; on the contrary, they have distinct personalities and needs. Relocating them in motivating environments will make them happy, and you'll win their favour.
Starting your adventure
Terraria starts its gameplay slow and steady, as it should be. You begin your journey with only 3 tools (sword, axe, pickaxe) at your disposal and a companion useful for his crafting guides. It’s up to you the player whether you want to challenge the game since your imagination, skill and creativity shape the word and thus the adventure. As a tip, I suggest you start building a small house in the beginning.
Events

By: Majordomo
Besides killing bosses, random events will pop up during your playthroughs that, in turn, add an extra layer of challenge.
Interactive playstyle
Terraria forces you the player to manipulate the environment to survive. You can chop trees used for crafting; mine rocks used for building or combine all the materials to cross large gaps etc. Physics plays a major role in the game’s playstyle, so do expect lots of deaths caused by fall damage. There is also a small detail concerning nightfall, but that’s a surprise for you to explore.
Creativity 
Community Created Artwork for Steam Artwork

The game offers a variety of blocks and items that encourage creativity. You can even build your mini-golf park! The goal here is to have fun and not just constantly grind for loot.
Scaling
Grinding
Terraria is very famous for its grinding potential. There are many repeatable bosses, each offering different and unique treasure bags that are considered valuable for your future encounters. Countless items offered by a specific boss or gained by certain activities, such as fishing, have a very low drop percentage . This concept favours repeatability, so do be patient, as sometimes even the best things in life take a while.
Classes
There are 4 classes in Terraria: Magic, Ranged, Melee and Summoning. Each class requires different armour sets and weapons that provide unique stats and abilities, depending upon the material they were made from. It is most favourable to stick with 1 class during a playthrough, as this way you can aim your focus on specific items and equipment. Read the Wiki [terraria.gamepedia.com] and choose carefully which role to main first.
Loot
There are lots of accessories, mounts as well as vanity items with interesting specialities that bring joy to competitive and creative players alike. A perfect example is the Cloud in a Bottle which grants the user the ability to extra-jump midair. You can combine the accessories to create even stronger ones in the Tinkerer's Workshop. There are countless combinations, so take your time while reading the Wiki. [terraria.gamepedia.com]
Wiki, Wiki and more Wiki
Overall, the experience is amazing, however, the learning curve is extremely demanding. This is a feature that does not go well with many players. As you have noticed above, you will have to consult the wiki regularly to truly master the game. Otherwise, you going to encounter many problems and difficulties that eventually will lead to confusion. Terraria is very grind demanding game, so bring some friends in your journeys as co-op is more than encouraging!
👁‍🗨 Visuals:
Terraria runs pretty well even on a potato Pc. It is a small game with a gorgeous yet simple artstyle that continues to captivate me to this day. The game runs smoothly in low settings with minor loading times. In the rare case you encounter problems with performance, I suggest you turn off the effects.
🎧 Audio:
Terraria’s music is exceptional in its way. Every biome, boss as well as event has its unique song that fits the theme. I encourage you to buy Terraria: Official Soundtrack as it proves to be a piece of excellent background music to listen to. You also provide a small token of appreciation to the developers.
🗃️ Side Notes:
Terraria is a challenging game for those who want to reach its completion. Before starting your adventure, I recommend you to get accustomed to terms like Pre-Hardmode - Hardmode mode etc. The game takes time to master, so do not get disappointed if you are struggling in the beginning. Be patient and most importantly have fun.
If you crave more challenges the tMoadLoader (available on Steam) will become your best friend, so why don’t you give it a try!!

📋 Verdict:
Having in mind its low price compared to the amount of content that it offers, I consider Terraria a gaming paradise for both creative and challenge thirsty players. It refers to all ages, as its unique gameplay encourages fun and creativity. You can build constructions, kill enemies, fight bosses, everything depends upon your playstyle. We are stealing a church!
I need to express my enormous gratitude to Re-Logic, as their sheer will and passion made this masterpiece relevant, with many updates and tweaks beloved by the community.

You'll never find a game more ripe with content, more beloved by its developers, more replayable, more visually an audibly beautiful for 10 bucks. This is a modern masterpiece
Posted: September 20, 2023
Terraria is old, very old... it had so many "this is the final update" updates that I lost count, the developers seem to just love it too much to let go (all of said upgrades of course completely free!)
The level of value delivered for this game is unbelievable, fun platforming, fun combat, fun exploration, it's a complete package of all things awesome that a 2d game can offer.
Not to mention how much you can extend your experience with mods and special seeds (added by the developers) that fundamentally change the game.
On top of that, re-logic (the makers of terraria) just decided to support Godot and FNA to help out other game developers hopefully achieve a similar level of success that they did... a true class act.
I bought terraria in all platforms I own, highly highly highly recommended, 10 bucks for THOUSANDS of hours for high quality fun is a steal

It is a simply charming game, with hours upon hours of fun. Every waking moment you discover something new. Why don't you try it yourself? It is indeed the greatest labor of love. Unpopular opinion but I think Relogic shouldn't move on from developing Terraria, but that's just me.
Buy this game, buy it to your friends, buy it to your dog, I don't care. Just buy it.

You can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun. You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats. You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn. You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble.
It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension. Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there. It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination.
Posted: June 5, 2015
This Indie sandbox game really has a little something for everyone.
Whether you are into building, creating pixel art, PvP, PvE, this game has something for you!
Once you've made your character, you start off in the world of Terraria. Your first goal is survival. During the first day, you deal with pesky slimes while you gather the materials needed to build a shelter before nightfall. Once night comes, the undead swarm you. Are you resting safely in your new house, or are you forced to fight until daybreak?
If you thought slimes and undead were all you had to worry about in this world, you were wrong. Outlandish minions and deadly bosses await every turn, as you explore the many different environments in the world. Defeating them will reward you with new materials, weapons, armor, and even trophies to display.
Beware of the corruption, an environment native to Terraria, that slowly spreads, trying to shroud your world in darkness. Or, will your world contain the crimson? A festering landscape, oozing with blood and flesh that constantly tries to devour you. You will not be left defenceless against these horrors, however! You can work to purify the land to its original state.
In your travels, you will find resources that you can mine and gather. Combine them into powerful weapons and armor, or shape them into building blocks for new structures. As you grow and progress, NPCs will begin to flock to your buildings, offering you aid. You will even find some out in the world, waiting to be rescued.
Tunnel through the earth, or take wing and fly to the clouds. Purify or corrupt. Build or destroy. The world of Terraria is yours to explore, and mold into your image.

... should probably write a review for this game at some point.
Here's how I'd summarize Terraria:
Your goal is to make a super powerful character that destroys all the boss monsters.
And then you destroy those boss monsters.
Along the way, you go exploring, mining, build some 2D houses, explore *a* dungeon or two, farm a bunch of mob loot...
Oh, and just for fun, there's also fishing, golfing, logic circuits, dress-up, a thousand decorative items for building, ...
When getting new people into this game, I noted these common issues:
You rarely know what to do next. The onboarding *exists*, the hints are *there*, but it's not enough to replace a wiki.
While the spritework is nice, the small scale of everything holds it back. Various details in tiles and character cosmetics are too small to really appreciate, which can make the look of the game unappealing to some people. (Though if you're already looking at this review, you probably won't mind that as much.)
The game's "two phases" appeal to different people. Early game is slow, with slow exploration, awkward attacks, and a bunch of "hold left click for 10 minutes" moments. Late game is fast-paced, challenging, and almost rushes by. If you're ONLY into one of these two, you may have trouble dealing with the other.
The small scale, coupled with the fast pace of combat in the lategame, lead to some visibility problems. Aiming at enemies that are off-screen is a somewhat common occurrence in this game.
My recommendation for your first playthrough:
Play with friends, preferably someone who already knows how this game works.
When making a character, choose "Classic" ("drop coins on death"). "Mediumcore" is a big deal, so don't choose that unless you know what you're in for.
When making a world, *try* Expert mode, *especially* when playing multiplayer. A lot of the more interesting mechanics are only available there.
If you're playing solo (or nobody in your group knows what to do), talk to the Guide NPC a LOT, or use a wiki.
Start by exploring and making basic houses, continue by battling a few bosses, THEN get into building fancier things. (You gain a lot of building/mining abilities at that point.)
Anytime you find a new item that has "Material" written in its description, show it to the Guide NPC to learn what it's for.
Dropping the doll in the lava will have serious consequences.
This game's great. Not for everyone, but I still get obsessed with it every now and then.
One should not wish for sequels, but if this game ever got one, I'd have high hopes for it.
The mods are also great. Lots of cool content to explore there, if you're ever craving for more.
Give it a try. It's dirt cheap for what it is.

Wow... 10 years...
I wasn't the first Terrarian by a long shot, but my mother was among the ones in Beta/Alpha (I don't remember which one, I just know it was beginning stages). She played it, fell in love with its charm, and knew I would enjoy it as well, so a few months after its full release, she bought it for me as a gift. I fell in love, just as she did, the charm of the visuals, simplicity of the game play, the music that gives me nostalgia each time I hear it (especially the daytime track, those beeps and boops are forever ingrained in my head). I played for hours and hours just fiddling around, digging, exploring, creating more worlds to explore and dig into just for the fun of it. I played to the point I FAR surpassed my mother in Terraria knowledge, and she often asked me for help XD. I watched from the sidelines (as I was/am too shy to really go into the community) as the game grew, changed, and developed into what it is now. While I honestly do not play as much as I used to, I mostly played after big updates to play around and explore with the new content, I still hold those memories fondly, and I'm pretty sure I still have my first world out in my files somewhere.
But that's enough story time, you came for my review:
I can't recommend this game enough to ANYONE who has any interest in the genre, the pixel graphics are incredibly charming and cute, the controls might take a small amount of getting used to for some people unfamiliar with it, but they're not hard. The content is vast, you almost NEED to go into the wiki pages if you want to see it all. You can easily sink hours into the game if you're not careful, and literally explore worlds upon worlds of some fascinating procedurally generated landscapes and tunnels. The price of the game is definitely worth the amount of content you get.
If there was anything I can think of (at this moment) that could be a downside, it might be that it could be a bit too easy to not know what to do, especially if you are playing on your own at first, and have no idea what you are supposed to do, there is a Guide NPC, but he doesn't exactly convey much about what needs to be done.
Yet at the same time, that's part of the point, this game is about freedom, to do whatever you want in whatever way you want to do it.
Happy 10 years, Terraria <3

Terraria is a game I recommend everyone to own on Steam. It consistantly goes on sale for $2.50, and this game offers dozens of hours of solid entertainment.
To be completely honest, for years I did not like Terraria. The biggest problem with the game is you literally don't know what to do or how to progress in the game without looking up a guide on the Terraria Wiki, or by asking more experienced players. To me, I just find that as bad game design. There could have been some sort of quest log that gave you some indication of what to do next, otherwise the beginning of the game becomes rather dull.
Moving on, once you do know what you are doing, the game becomes surprisingly more enjoyable as Terraria focuses on combat and boss encounters. Each boss is different from one another, and are actually challenging. The game limits you from getting better gear until a specific boss is defeated which keeps the challenge high throughout.
Apart from that, as you kill bosses new enemies and events will appear in the game unlocking a vast new variety of weapons, items, and equipment.
One thing I had not realized is the incredible amount of content Terraria offers. As soon as you think you are done with the game, it just keeps going with even more bosses, more grind for even better gear, and just so much new stuff as you go along. (be sure to keep checking the wiki to see what bosses are next and how to unlock them)
It is very important that you play this game with a friend. Playing it solo is simply not as fun, especially considering the time investment.
General overview:
+ Loads of content
+ Fun combat system with a large variety of weapons, spells, and gear.
+ Lots of fantastic bosses
+ Very challenging
+ An ever-changing world with loads to explore
+ Great fun with friends
+ Very easy to host a server and game is very minimal on resources (meaning anyone with a PC can enjoy this, even on a laptop)
- Somewhat impossible to progress without a guide
- The first half of the game is rather boring compared to the later half
- A bit straining on the eyes with pixel graphics, especially with a high resolution monitor
- A bit too challenging at times (especially playing solo)
- Resources are limited, meaning you won't be able to get items without generating a new world (your character can move between worlds and servers) Highly recommend generating a medium to large world
To sum things up, Terraria is a fantastic game to play with at least one friend (preferably just 2-4 ). It offers an extremely high amount of content, lots of bosses, fun gameplay, lots to explore and craft, and its cheap!
+++ Highly recommend.

I will be brief. I could give a long song and dance about how much I love this game and how good it is, but you've heard it all before. Instead, i'll share the fact that I have 1001 hours logged on this game at the time of writing this review. So I like it at least 1001 hours' worth. In closing: play this game, it is good. Thank you for your time.

I have 2780 (Edit: Now 3150 (Edit 2: Now 3908 (Edit 3: Now 4198)) hours on this game. That's over 100 (Edit: Now 130 (Edit 2: Now 162.8 (Edit 3: Now 174.9)) days straight.
I enjoyed it the whole time.
I'm not even CLOSE to being done with everything I want to do in this game either.
It's worth buying, especially for only $10.

Let's start the review with the obvious: go buy this game.
Now, let's get to the review:
Everybody (that doesn't play Terraria) says that this game is 2D Minecraft. Well, they're wrong. Terraria is like Minecraft but better in any way.
Exploring feels like it should be: quick, simple and rewarding and the arsenal of tools like pickaxes, drills, ropes and torches makes that even more enjoyable. The environment is full of chests and vases that reward you just for walking around. You can also found Heart Crystals that boost your Max HP and Fallen Stars that boost your Max Mana.
Combat feels clumsy at the beggining, but the more you play, the better it will get. The combat turns from a Copper Sword Stabby-Stab to Missiles, Bursts of Energy, Homing Bullets, Falling Meteorites, Massive Swords.
Mining is as it should be: quick! You can spend only 5min just mining a rare ore, where in Minecraft, you will spend hours to find Diamonds and it depends on layers, stripminings, caverns, etc. In Terraria, you have things to help you find ore more easily, such as better tools, Pets that give you light, torches that highlight treasures, potions that show you where the treasures is, equipables that describe your surroundings, bombs/tnt that, for sure, help you get rid of the terrain and you don't feel that you've wasted your materials spending them.
The Progression in this game is top notch. In the beggining you can't even beat a blob, but as soon as you grab some armor you can beat it easily. It's fun to discover that you're still too weak to walk to other biomes like the desert and jungle. And after you get comfortable with the gameplay, when you can beat every mob in the world, the game has the BALLS to strip that liberty away and put you in Noob Phase again. The switch between Pre-Hardmode and Hardmode is a huge step for gaming. It strips your sense of greatness without striping you off your items.
The world, your map change with the flow of the game, new ores appear, the ore changes between worlds, so it is never the same, new mobs appear, corrupted biomes spread to other biomes, and if you don't pay attention, it will, eventually, take over the whole map.
Even if you had explored the map previously, you will still explore the same areas because new ore, loot and enemies will appear. It never gets old being killed by Unicorns and Pixie Fairies.
This is the first game where I do like brewing my potions, in Minecraft that function feels useless, either you don't use it at all, or you only use it for boss fights or breathing underwater. In Terraria you use them for everything. You use potions for Scaveging, Danger Hunting, Boss Fighting, Teleporting, Flying, Water Walking... It feels good using potions, and you don't feel cheated when you use them.
Fishing is under appreciated. This mechanic is way better than Minecraft's or Stardew Valley's. You are not obligated to do it, but it will reward you with ore, vanity items, furniture, money, very good equipables, rods, bait, fish (that can be used for potions). It can be boring at times, but you don't even have to be alert, it functions with a simple mouse click.
Building is god-like, you can build everything, you have all kinds of furniture, you can mold blocks with your hammer, and you can even paint all blocks in the game or create your custom biomes with paint. Even if you are bad at building and you'd like to build great things (like me) you can easily copy any screenshot of any building you see browsing the web. The houses you building will all feel comfortable.
Wiring is like Minecraft's Redstone, but more simpler (sometimes). Wiring gives you the opportunity to build traps, build farms and teleport yourself around the map (yes, TELEPORT). Wiring also gives you motives to be careful when exploring caves because there might be traps lurking.
Even if you play alone, your world feels alive, everywhere you go you have something. Wanna go left/right? You have Desert, Tundra, Jungle, Beaches, Meteorite, Hallow, Corruption/Crimson. Wanna go up? You have Sky Islands and Sky Lakes.
Wanna go down? You have Granite, Marble, Spider-Nests, Mushroom Biomes, and even Hell (Underworld).
The world isn't infinite like in Minecraft (I know it isn't infinite, but c'mon) but it still feels huge, and it even will change overtime with your adventure.
Terraria will still offer you options like Pets, Light Pets, Mounts, Minecarts, Grappling Hooks and even Wings that you can collect if you feel like getting all the items.
Even with all of this variety Terraria will offer events like Blood Moon, Solar Eclipse, etc which will give you another look at more new mobs, even more loot and even more fun. Some of the events change over time too, and offer great loot.
And the bosses? Omg, the bosses are amazing. When you play, you're always thinking of when the new one's gonna come out. You'll get addicted to beat bosses, and Terraria has a fair share of bosses. In the beggining they feels kinda weak and easy, but it will change over time too. Bosses have themes behind them, Queen Bee is in the Jungle, Eater of Worlds is in the Corruption, Moon Lord appears after you defeat the Lunar Events, etc.
Ah, and it even has multiple classes, and each and every one of them feels rewarding to play. Every one of them is fun to play, and the game doesn't force you to choose one of them at the beggining of the game, giving you time to experiment each class during your playtime.
NPC's, in Terraria are very good and distinguished from each other. They don't look alike and don't "NAH" "OH" around. Each have their own personality and each one of them serves a purpose and gives life to your world, you will never feel alone.
After all of this, you get another difficulty, which increases the difficulty (ofc), but increases the drop quality and it even gives you Expert only items that are worth the difficulty just for the items alone.
The game feels rewarding and delivers in everything that is shown, and it is still being updated.
This game is not grindy, you will only have to grind for specific items that are not required.
And even with all of that, you still have mods. I have not experienced them, but everybody , in the Terraria community, knows that mods are god like. Mods like Calamity and Thorium are a must.
And the Soundtrack is very good. Each biome has it's own theme, and it's very recognizable. You can tell the day/night cycle just by listening, or the biome you're in and the transitions between biomes are very well made. The bosses have their own themes too, but I'm always too busy fighting them so I don't even have the chance to listen.
I've played so many games and I have NEVER seen a community like Terraria's. Everyone is so helpful, and the Youtubers are so memorable, from Happydays to Python and Grobeman.
So, after reading my review, and looking at the "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews for this game, what's your excuse for not buying? It's the best time to buy this game, it will get another update soon full with new stuff. This game is still relevant, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Seriously, why don't my friends like this game?!
