以前，我不知道Steam，在宅霸上玩Un，第一次玩不知道干什么，一位大佬就热情的带我，我们也就玩，后来来了新人我也带，我们玩的都很开心。后来，网易来了，宅霸被封了，我的朋友们的联系方式都没有，我恨网易，现在，我玩steam
，游戏有了，我的朋友没了，现在，我决定要带新人，来一个新人带一个，让他们不退游，我希望我能碰到他们。

A teenage developer who manages to release great updates every week, new, detailed maps several times a year and no pay to win; this is a really good game. 500 hours and still enjoying myself. The Gold Upgrade lets you change the colour of your skin (Possibly to abuse as camouflage) I see this as the only major advantage a paying player would have over a free-to-play player.
EDIT: This review is receiving a lot of critique, to clear up: Most free to play games rely on overpowered bonuses to get people to buy in-game products. This game lets you camouflage better and have more storage space by switching between characters. In comparison to other pay-to-win games this is a very small bonus. I'd say most people buy it to support the developer with the small bonuses as an extra incentive.
EDIT 2: It's free to play, you can't expect a perfect game from a single developer. Additionally, he needs a way to incentivize people to buy the Gold Upgrade for him to make any money. If it was completely useless, fewer people would buy it. It really doesn't affect gameplay all that much.
Overall: Good game. I like it. Not pay-to-win like many other games in this genre. 9/10

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Easily one of the best free to play games on Steam. This is a genre that has been over-done, but Unturned manages to be unique in it's own way. Kill zombies, gather resources, hunt animals, craft things and scavenge for items. That's all you do.
You only have 3 types of enemies in Unturned, there's the normal, the military and the Mega zombies, the latter being quite rare and way more powerful which will make you want to run if you encounter one, especially if you're playing on Hard, but Unturned is more about the quantity of enemies... if you get swarmed, you're gonna have a bad time!
The beauty in Unturned stands in how simple it is, yet manages to be fun and quite graphically stunning. The developer team is just one single developer, and he's about 17 years old, that is something that should always be remembered, because not only does he update the game on a regular basis (about twice a week now), he has improved this game from an almost unplayable mess for older computers which was v2.0, to a polished and really smooth game v3.0 is.
I still haven't bought the Gold Upgrade, but I'm planning on doing it, just because I want to "donate" to Nelson Saxton, this is how Free to Play should be. There's no "BUY HP FOR 5$", the game is COMPLETELY free, and all you get from the golden upgrade is cosmetic stuff, like new facial expressions, skin coloring and access to the Gold servers, which are restricted to "Premium" members (great for when you want to avoid F2P newbies). Again, there is more content but it's not shoved in your face 24/7, and it doesn't really make you a superior, more well-equipped player for owning it.
There's a set of skills where you use the experience you gather from killing zombies, hunting animals and harvesting resources, these skills are all very helpful to your survival, and will take their time to be fully upgraded. For now there's the Offense, Defense, and Support skills, maybe we'll see more in the future :)
There are numerous items in this game and for the looks of it, new items are still being added in each update. Weapons go from Hockey Sticks and Golf clubs, to Sniper Rifles, Machine Guns and more. You can find some vehicles too with a Fuel system, which means you can't go everywhere with your car without scavenging for fuel first. There's also tons of food around, but good luck on finding it in good condition, because Unturned also uses an item quality system. You can eat a carrot, but if it's moldy, your illness percentage will increase and you'll end up scavenging for pills in order to cure it.
Do you remember how satisfying it felt in Resident Evil 4, when you had your inventory all organized and in place? Unturned now has the same type of inventory in v3.0, which is way more realistic than the inventory in v2.0. An item takes X number of squares depending on it's size. Oh, and you can choose 2 of these items for quick switching with the 1 and 2 keys, you'll probably put your weapon/tool here, since a zombie always appears out of the blue!
There's not much more to say about Unturned, it's a great game where you and your friends can spend lots of hours just creating a house and equipping it, or just scavenging and exploring Prince Edward Island to find all the secrets that lies within it. Unturned is a must play to anyone who has a Steam account, even if it is for just 1 hour, it will be enough to see the effort of a young developer which I undoubtedly respect. I'm not saying it's the best game ever, I even admit it can be a bit boring after some time (for me), but for the price of 0$, it's an awesome game, and I'm pretty sure I'll play it in the future to check out the updates.
Score: 8/10

The game itself is fantastic. The community on the other hand is garbage. Only servers without admins are playable. The admins for this game are almost universally children who are sore losers and will spawn themselves items and teleport to you if you kill them. This is a DayZ style game, dying is part of it. But losing everything you've spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected. However, an admin should be playing the most legitimately. This is simply not the case. They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun. They are the most corrupt players I have encountered. And I am including hackers. Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin. Even if you follow all the rules, if the admin doesn't like you for whatever reason. You are going to die. Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells. Every person you see could be an admin, and god forbid you kill an admin. Ten seconds later all you will hear is a "Blam" now you're dead. Why? Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children. Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose. And this abuse of power will usually be followed by degenerate badmouthing.
Play the game, don't play on severs with admins.

How this game is not super popular, I do not know. It's a mix of Minecraftish/DayZ/RUST with its own unique art style. It can be modded, you can create your own maps and share them, and it is still, to this day, constantly being updated.
Oh, did I mention, it was all created by a 15 year old kid in Canada who has now grown up and still works his ass off on it. There is always some new feature or some bugs he is hammering out. To have a passion for anything like this young man has for this game and his business is a dream. Good on you! -and great job-

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
(This review only applies for Unturned 2.0, 2014 Steam launch week)
One of few apocalypse survival games that truly grows from the community. The dev works on this everyday and is always looking for feedback and opinions on how the game is shaped, also constantly putting out strawpolls to the community and listens to us.
Unturned is played how you want, example, if you only want PVE you can select your server and if you want a PVP experience with your PVE you can select PVP enabled on your server, and yes, you can host your own servers on your computer.
It starts out like many other apocalypse survival games: you start out with your fists and 4 slots for your inventory. You have a lot of places you can wander to when you spawn, like a cabin camp, small town, military base, and many more. Your main mission when you start is to grab a melee, some food with drink, and a backpack. Once you've acquired these necessities, you may wish to find a gun if you want to PVP, or you may want to collect seeds to start a farm, or even start chopping down trees to make yourself a cozy place to spend the night.
The PVP system is great also, server hosts can select if players can bring in loot from their server (best for PVP) or not be able to bring loot in (Best for PVE Immersion). There is a leaning system so you can peek corners also. You can also SHOOT OUT OF CARS (but not from the drivers seat of course)! Load some of your buddies in the trunk of your truck and do a hillbilly drive-by if you wish!
The towns are well structured for PVP also, their are lot of CQC battles to be fought, and also small hills for sniping, but snipers can be easily flanked if you don't post up right!
Base raiding is also important in PVP too. People on public servers will build structured bases equipped with sniper pits, plenty of windows, and escape routes! You must observe a player's base and attack it strategically, you never know how many players may be in there!
Now, time to farm my crops and build my base, I recommend you do so also!

Since there's hardly any actual reviews regarding this game with factual information, I've decided to write one. This game is a free-to-play steam game, so obviously anyone can really play this. That being said, unturned is a zombie survival game which requires you to gather weapons, food, water, and other resources to stay alive. So far there are 3 (official) maps implimented into the game. It's possible to download more along with other weapons and items from the community workshop. You can play this game by yourself, with friends, or just join a multiplayer server. The game offers PVP and PVE game types. The game offers 3 difficulty types: easy, normal, and hard. If you do play this game and decide you like it, you can always purchase the "Permanent Gold Upgrade" for $4.99 which gives you a few gold items for your character. The money goes to Nelson Sexton, the creator of Unturned. Anyway with that review being said, let's list the pro's and con's!
Pro's:
-Free-to-play (unless you decide to support Nelson by purchasing the gold upgrade)
-Fun to play for any age group
-Ability to play on a private server with friends (using hamachi)
-Crafting system
-Level up/skills system
-Free form building and the ability to create your own base
-Many different weapons and items
-Huge maps that offer a lot of stuff to do
Con's:
-The community on servers is cancer. They're basically a 10 year old version of DayZ or H1Z1 players.
-The hit range can sometimes be a bother. Seems like zombies can hit you a lot farther away than you can hit them.
-The night cycle seems rather long.
Anyway that's my review, I hope it helped.

Best survival I've played in a while
The game is full of places to explore, hunt, and scavenge for items to survive. With a variety of weapons and attachments at your disposal, you can hunt down animals, zombies, and other players.
(Weapon Segment)
The fact that every attachment is compatable with every weapon, as long as it has the slot for it (Barrel, Tactical, Sight, ect.), Makes choosing your weapon fun. You have yourself an Outfield? Put a Silencer, Bipod, and a x12 Scope on it and you have an effective silenced sniper. Don't have a x12 Scope, Silencer, or Bipod? Take 2 duct tape and craft it with binoculars. Then take 2 empty cans and 2 cans of Cola and craft them with fire from a Campfire. Finally, find a Tactical Laser. All these will make a Zoomomatic (Scope that is better than the x6, but no reticle), a Muffler (Silent shooting, but muzzle flash still active), and the Tactical laser acts as a reticle for the Zoomomatic. It's the small things like this that I love in survival games. Being able to create a makeshift sniper using little Millitary grade equipment is just one example of the combinations of weapons and attachments.
(Survival Segment)
The surviving aspect is also amazing. Hunger, Thirst, and Illness are what keep you alive. Unlike most games, they go up as you get hungry, thirsty, and sick (At least in the games I've played, they go down). Make sure to Keep them down by eating food and drinking any drink. Illness can be gained from multiple sources, such as getting hit by zombies and eating raw/rotten foods and drinks. Illness can only be brought down with Vitamins, Anti-biotics, and a type of berry and it's crushed counterpart. You can go from town to town scavenging food and drinks, or you can take to the hills in search of wildlife to hunt. Grab a fire axe, handsaw, and pickaxe to start building a base in the hills, or fortify the roof of a building. Build traps for zombies and players alike. Light up an area with generators and worklights.
(Experience Segment)
As you hunt animals, kill zombies, collect wood, and mine rocks, you will tend to notice a notification at the top of your screen informing you that you have gained som experience. At the start of Unturned, you are very vulnurable, But fear not. Pressing the button you have bound to open up inventory (Default is Tab) will reveal....your inventory. At the bottom you will see three tabs labeled Apperal, Crafting, and Skills. Selecting Skills will replace your character at the right with many options. The top shows your current experience and the red bars show the ammount of levels it can be upgraded by (Red being levels not yet achieved and Green being current level). For starters, you should focus on upgrading Survival (Slower thirst and hunger gained) and Immunity (Heal more effectivly and less Illness gained from zombie hits and raw/rotten foods). After that, you can decide if you want to upgrade Stamina to outrun the zombies or Warrior to fight back. Build more structures and traps with Crafting. Sneak around zombies and towards wildlife with Sneakybeaky. Take the shot with little recoil thanks to Marksman. Chop and mine faster with Outdoors. These Skills make surviving easier, just make sure to keep an eye on the Hunger and Thirst bar.
In summary, this game as a fantastic weapon system, challenging survival, and rewarding skills. 10/10 for both the game and this being my longest review ever.

I'll be honest, I personally don't care about the game. Its an all around solid zombie survival open world game. Not too much to say about it. However, what I do care about is the dev. He is a fantastic example of what a dev can be, and deserves all the support he can get. He is a wonderful cinnamon bun that should be cherrished in this land of abandonware and liars.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is an example of an F2P game done right. You have access to EVERYTHING, except for extra customization for your character. And, to get the extra customization? Get the gold upgrade. And it's permanent, unlike other F2P games where you have to make $50 microtransactions every month for an account. It's very realistic, and with great mechanics and items and realism. Also, thought I'd mention this game is made by a 17-year-old guy. No-one else. One of the best games I've played. 10/10

My points is this game can be enjoyed with out paying a single dime.
You just pay to look cooler.
Gold membership allows you to be more creative and create a very unique character of your own design.
Pros :
Can be played on a potato PC.
You will find a lot of good friends.
If PVP isn't your thing you can play PVE and not get killed 100000 times.
Workshop items are good and you will have fun when you get to the workshop item testing stage.
Can be played in so many different ways.
New stuff every Friday.
Cons: The community is childish.
Your ears may bleed from screaming toddlers call themselves pro cuz they spawn camp.
Too many obnoxious russians.
Your skin count makes difference to how pro you are.
Yet again a lot of kids play this, But the community is not as toxic as CSGO which is surprising because CSGO is a paid game.
The game is dead and is only played by kids or f2p's.
7/10.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As you play, you will have to worry about four main things; Irradiation, hunger, thirst, and health. Irradiation is the hardest to take care of once you progress. If you get into battles with hoardes of zombies, you can easily die due to radiation sickness.
Health is also pretty dificult to take care of, but not nearly as much. You can heal from eating, using medkits, and a few other actions. Hunger and thirst are the easiest to take care of. You can find canteens, and fill them with ocean water to avoid having to find bottled water or soda. You can also grow crops, and cultivate a farm at a location of your choice. A few tips I can give are:
Set up a base away from zombies or towns, they can attack and destroy crops, and bases.
Be sure to NEVER provoke zombies once you first start with no weapon, unless you are an older player.
Also, make sure that the first thing you do is raid a farmhouse, you can find arrows, bows, guns, axes, bats, chainsaws, etc.
You will sometimes find what I like to call the "Hulk"
It is a zombie that is larger than normal, and does alot of damage. If you try to fight him, be sure to kite him, or just shoot him.
If you don't know what kiting is, it is when you allow the enemy to attack, and when he is done attacking, stab him, then quickly run back before he hits you. Just do that continuously to kill him.
The "Hulk" can drop a variety of military grade weapons. You may find that the most prominent of all is the "Dragonfang"
The Dragonfang is an LMG, with a magazine size of 100. Also, there is crafting in this game, which is much too complicated to get into on a post, but i can say that you can repair weapons, craft barricades, walls, doors, roofing, gun attachments, apparel, bandages, and many other things.
Also, be sure to check out the airport or military base when you get very good gear.
If you find any of what i said intrigueing, then by any means necessary, get this game.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Okay as I've lately gained interest in this again since 2014 and I've played it a lot more, this is my review for "Unturned" (scroll to bottom for TL;DR)
Things have improved A LOT since it's first release that I will list.
- Map, the map is no longer "Canada" it is now still placed in Canada but now Prince Edward Islands which I have to say is a lot better than the Canada map. (imo)
- Gameplay, the biggest change in gameplay is the balance and additions to the skill system which are good. Still lacking as I think there's great potential for perks for skills.
- Gunplay, the gunplay in this game is a lot better since the recoil feels really good and the amount of modifications for the guns is a really good size.
- Multiplayer, wow has the multiplayer in this game gotten good, no longer do you have to search up tutorials on how to join servers and try to find servers that still even run. You just open up a server list and you can search for the most players, best ping, easy or normal games, or just join any server you see, your choice.
There are multiple difficulties including easy normal hard and premium, although most are normal with stupid plugins and rules such as starterkits and no KOS.
- Graphics, nelson changed the game to a newer version so that came along with better lighting, reflections and better particles.
- Vehicles, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are way better, funny how an 18 year old dev can create better driving than overkill software (creators of payday 2).
- Performance, it performs statistically a lot better since he updated the game to a newer version of the engine he uses. I doubt you'll run this game bad though.
|x| Thanks for reading my review, If you have anything to ask me or want me to add, shoot a comment on this review. |x|
TL;DR : Game has improved a lot over the course of a year and he's planning more like a new map set in america and a bunch of weapons.

In a few words, this is the DayZ for people who can't afford DayZ, or their battlestations can't handle it.
It looks weird, but it sure is fun.
+ Addictive
+ Completley free
+ Does not require too much
I do recommend this game, to anyone who can't play DayZ for reasons, mentioned earlier.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I loved this game, so fun. the fact that Nelson ties the community into the development well is awesome. during my 314.2 hours with this game, ive blown up more things than i can count. ive met some of my friends I now know from this game, and I never regret the moment i pressed play game, with the free to play mark next to that green button. if this game ever goes cash bought, i would buy it, and Im sure many of us players would too. keep up the great work Nelson, and do the do's that other f2p games have failed at.

Product received for free
If you want to play this game, here are some notes and points I would like to give
1. If you want to play with friends, I'd recommend creating/ renting a dedicated server using the Unturned Dedicated Server Tool. this game's community's focus is mostly PVP, you might find PVE servers, But you should just make your own
2. Unturned is maintained by Nelson Sexton, the Founder of Smartly Dressed games.
3. This is Unturned 3.0 (or the third total revision of Unturned), not to be confused with Unturned 2, a unreleased project
4. Cosmetics, Unturned features cosmetics, as well as a Gold membership (A single payment 4.99 USD + tax) however, all of this is unnecessary for fun game-play.
5. Do I recommend this game, Yes, however I personally do not like playing on public servers, and prefer to play with friends on a self hosted server. Play the way you want, and do not let anyone tell you otherwise.
Have a nice day

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Unturned is an indie free-to-play multiplayer open world survival video game designed and published by Nelson Sexton, the owner and founder of Smartly Dressed Games.
Unturned is a sandbox game in the emerging multiplayer apocalypse survival genre. Rather than focusing on being an MMO it provides players with easy systems to sit down and survive the zombie infestation with their friends. Over the course of a typical adventure, groups will face impossible odds as they work at fortifying locations, scavenging for supplies, trying to live off the land and negotiating with other people.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Unturned is phenomenal game. The fact that this game has been developed by a 16 year old astonishes me. The aesthetics suit the game. Yes, the graphics are not great. However, I think, it should stay like this. It gives the game an identity. When I first played the game, I was not expecting much. I wasn't expecting a full on tactical rpg, or a racing game, or a base build survival co op, or a PVP open world deathmatch. I wasn't expecting any of these. Yet, it offered all of this. Survival is very rewarding. However, be warned, your stuff can vanish depending on the server. Dont get too attached to your items. Sandbox servers are the best as they allow you to do anything you want.
Unturned is a blast, you can really do anything. However, the community can be very toxic sometimes. Depending on how you look at it. In conclusion: The game does no other triple A game has done. H1Z1 and DayZ don't feel that friendly. Unturned feels friendly to new comers. Just bring a friend and scavenge the post apocalyptic environment.
Surprisingly there is lore in the world of Unturned. I'll leave you to discover the hidden lore.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
600 hours of experience and very well known on the workshop, so I pretty much have seen it all.
Unturned is rather mixed. Most servers follow a pay to win format and are focused on PvP (get lucky to find a gun and kill everyone you meet) or die trying. These servers are trash. However if you join a server without plugins such as TPA and kits, it is completely different. It feels like a survival game more than a FPS. You get to build a base... only to get offline raided, fight off zombies while exploring towns, military bases, and other places. You get a chance to be the best rather than paying for a free gun kit and plane.
But why do I recommend this game? Simple. Besides the current state, it has been improving greatly since what it used to be a long time ago. The community has improved to an extent, the recent addition of bullet drop and scope sway makes sniping require more skill rather than a simple point, click the head and get an instant kill, and the workshops includes mods to suit almost anyone.
The workshop- it's brilliant. Nelson has done a good job with the additions he has made to Unturned, but the workshop has a lot of good content, including a lot of gun and hat skins (which has caused the economy to be similar to CS:GO or TF2) there are maps that can go up to 64 square kms and dwesigned for a lot of gamemodes. There's maps designed for survival similar to Washington/PEI and works well due to it's design, Maps that allow you to race, Maps such as mine (Isle of Wolves) which is based on progression, and of course arenas and maps to try and replicate famous maps such as Chernarus and Dust II. And some modders have added many workshop guns and vehicles too. Want to fire away at a horde of zombies with a minigun while your friend is flying you around on a Hummingbird? Now you can.
The graphics is rather a blocky and simple design. I don't dislike the design, but some people would be put off by it. Nelson has said he will improve it to have graphics that are similar to Firewatch. which I suppose is better, we'll have to find out ourselves. However this simple design makes it seem more like a cartoon than realism, which people could see it relate to games like Minecraft, just with guns.
If you are one who doesn't want to play the game due to factors such as the community, go ahead. But you're missing out.

For a free game, it is amazing!
You've got so many features that many paid open world games are missing plus the Developer is constantly updating the game.
I host a server for this game now and develop plugins, I'm really happy with this game. Thanks Nelson.

The community is ok. it is true that alot of 7-14 yr olds play this game (me included) but dont treat them too harshly, they are looking for having fun. Unless they are toxic.
This game deserves more attention as its fun and created by 1 cool and awesome guy. Huge amount of respect for him.

as much as people slander this game
the dev has probably done more with this game solo than most dev(s) do with most other survival games and to an extent most modern games (like jesus ♥♥♥♥ when did making a game solo = a good game and having an entire army of devs and coders make ♥♥♥♥ games from AAA titled companies like jesus ♥♥♥♥ man that's not logical).
He listens to the community, adds new content and fixes things with atm weekly updates, and you get free drops.
the community is far from tamed. Then again what do you expect for a free-2-play game.
Theres an option of buying gold, which granted you extra xp, but now its more cosmetic (it gives you cosmetics) as well as just buying it to support the creator.
overall its probably one of the best zombie/survival/zombie survival games i've ever played. Graphics aren't as important when the game actually works, and you keep adding content.
sideways 8/10.
This game deserves an overwhelming positive review unlike other fake games like DayZ, Factorio, DOTA 2, FALLOUT:76!!!!
edit: Unturned 2 is in the making apparently

The game is great.
I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam. People do that to trick you into giving you steam points (the steam currency) by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, lies and deceipt.
"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

It is simple and clear - It is really fun at the start until you have 600+ hours and it simply feels like a grind. But it is quite a good game still, because of the amount of time it actually had me interested in it for, much unlike h1z1 just survive or dayz that simply felt impossible to play after only 100 hours. Such shame this amount of time feels wasted, but I know it's not. Thanks to Nelson for making such a great game for players to enjoy free of charge.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The game itself is fantastic. The community on the other hand is garbage. Only servers without admins are playable. The admins for this game are almost universally children who are sore losers and will spawn themselves items and teleport to you if you kill them. This is a DayZ style game, dying is part of it. But losing everything you've spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected. However, an admin should be playing the most legitimately. This is simply not the case. They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun. They are the most corrupt players I have encountered. And I am including hackers. Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin. Even if you follow all the rules, if the admin doesn't like you for whatever reason. You are going to die. Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells. Every person you see could be an admin, and god forbid you kill an admin. Ten seconds later all you will hear is a "Blam" now you're dead. Why? Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children. Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose. And this abuse of power will usually be followed by degenerate badmouthing.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Unturned is a survival game where DayZ's gameplay meets Minecraft's look. It's developed by a 19 year old Canadian who is connected to the community and committed to updating/patching regularly. The game, while still in development, has a lot going for it. There's a lot of items, a good crafting system, skills to boost, and a survival system.
My complaints so far are the zombies are too slow and easy to kill and the map itself is rather small. I would also like to see some custom server options to address these issues. Also this game doesn't seem like it would be much fun single player. The human element really adds to survival games like this.
I do like what I see and so I bought the DLC to throw some money to the dev for his fun, free game. I consider it an investment for further growth.
So do I recommend it? Yes. Grabs some friends and try it out. It's free so you have nothing to lose. Then keep your eye on the development and we will see where this goes. Who knows maybe I'll see you out there. You'll know it's me when you see a guy wearing nothing but a chef's hat, and is tripping out of his mind, and clenching a sledgehammer menacingly. You know what? You might want to go the other direction. He's weird.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Unturned is another post-apocalyptic survival type game...
What sets it apart from the handful of other survival games coming out lately (After the success of things like minecraft and DayZ) is the heart, the community, the developer, and the fact that it's free haha.
I wouldn't say this game is amazing or inventive, but it is really really fun! The graphics are pretty basic, smooth flat coloured surfaces and blocky character models... but I like them a lot. I think the graphics, more than simple, are just plain charming. I love the silly character customization too. And who doesn't want to be able to survive in the apocalypse with their friends? Multiplayer for games like these is necessary, and I'm glad Unturned supports multiplayer gameplay.
I've heard a lot of people complaining that the beginning is too hard, but honestly as soon as I found a melee weapon I felt pretty set. If anything, I think the gameplay is too easy as it is right now. (This is before the big 3.0 update that is currently in developement) Once I established a base to store things in my character just stopped dying haha. Crafting is confusing and unintuitive though and I felt like it really took too many resources. (But maybe that's just me) the update is fixing that though with a built in crafting menu that gives you recipes based on the resources you have in your inventory. (As far as I can tell)
Once the newest version is released it will have a custom map maker as well! It's fairly easy to use once you've tinkered with it a little bit. I've already seen some amazing content from the community!
Anyway, If you're looking for something different from minecraft and dayz, look elsewhere.
But if you want a fun and simple survival game with lots of respawning zombies to headshot and constant content and gameplay updates, try it out. Why not? It's free! It also has some great PvP potential! (Hiding in fields, wearing camoflauge to sneak up on people, using things like trees, bushes, buildings to stealth with, etc)
Also, the game is being overhauled and so far the beta of the newest version really is adding a lot of improvements! I can't wait to see where this game goes!
Before I finish I'm going to say that the developer (Nelson Sexton) really puts a lot of hard work into this game. He listens to the community well and updates more than the other early access games I'm keeping my eyes on. I really apreciate how much time and effort he manages to put into Unturned.
I recommend buying gold if you like this game! The bonuses are worth the $5. (In my humble opinion)

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Unturned is a very easy game to judge at first glance. It doesn't appear to have amazing graphics, it has a Roblox-looking vibe, and there are noobs everywhere. Well, some of this IS true, but this is one of those games that you have to submerge yourself in a little before the true beauty shows. It can be seen as a game where you wander around chugging glue and getting high in order to stay alive a little longer...or it can be seen as a challenging survival experience where strategy is key. With full release said to be coming soon, let's see what early access is like in Unturned.
Unturned is a zombie apocalypse game where you must wander around as a human survivor to collect food, water, keep warm, and avoid zombies to stay alive as long as possible. You can find a plane if you want and go on a joy ride, then maybe you can start building a giant base, storing your prized finds from your adventures. After a few weeks of playing singleplayer, you've done everything. So why not check out multiplayer? There's plenty more to see and experience in this game.
Let's talk about the look, since that's one of the main things we focus on. The graphics have no crazy detail whatsoever, but that's not the point. The graphics are focused: You see what you need to see. You'll soon find that the models actually look quite pleasing in their basic and rounded look.
Alright what about the survival experience? It can be very challenging in its own unique way. You need to keep finding fresh food and water to stay alive, and you'll have to strategize and plan where you will go to satisfy your stomach. There is a temperature mechanic, where you will have to take cover in shelter during the cold and dress up to stay warm. It can be difficult to create a sustainable food source outside of towns. In short, the survival aspects in this game always keep you moving around the map like a nomad. You can settle down in one place...but not long before you have to make another run to Big J's Diner for some grub.
Let's talk PvP...a big aspect to this game. If you thought shooting zombies with a high caliber DragonFang is fun, try shooting at some other players in multiplayer. The gun mechanics are satisfying: You have your standard recoil, your aiming, but where this system really shines is the customization. This ranges from increasing accuracy with a barrel attachment, or alleviating recoil with a nice grip. The melee is pretty great too. With left-click, you get the standard attack for that given weapon. With right-click, and the sacrifice of a little enegery and a longer attack time, you can strike a heavy, hammering attack on both zombies, and players. The aspects put together are very easy to understand, and creates several opportunities for players to have their own technique.
Here are my PROS and CONS.
PROS:
-Great in it's simplicity | It's a very simple looking game, and that makes it special.
-Amazing PvP mechanics | The PvP in this game is very nice and customizable. Well balanced.
-No pay-to-win! | You can buy a Gold upgrade, and gun skins, but never any advantage-granting things.
-Player and UI (User Interface) customizability | Tune your looks to fit your style.
-Ties in with Steam groups | Make a Steam group for your Unturned team, it ties into multiplayer.
-Absolutely free (as of now) | Unturned is 100% free to play (this may change at full release...)!
-Easy to use map maker | The game features a great way for players to make their own maps.
-Steam Workshop capabilities | Design mods, skins, and more with the Steam Workshop.
I thought, since this review unexpectedly gained popularity, that I would take advantage of this situation to direct Nelson's attention to some things the community, and I, would like to see before full release. These have been gathered from both me, and comments I've seen from the comminity (Feel free to suggest more things in a reply to this review, I will add them if they seem fit for the game.)
-The return of the original Canada map, restored and re-balanced of course. :)
-Add an electrical system to the game. This could include ways to generate electricity, store it (to a certain extent), power other electric-requiring things (this could include car batteries).
Thank you so much for your efforts and time, Nelson!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
When I first came across this game, I honestly did not expect anything from it because of obvious reasons like the size. But guess what? It's the only game I'm hooked to these days. Survival has never been so luxurious. I know that this game has borrowed a lot of ideas from the other games, none of which I played, but I'm sure this will have new ideas and features as updates follow. And this game is free, so it definitely has a better grip than the rest. There is an update almost everyday as the game is being constantly improved. So I'm confident of a great final product.
Right now, I do have some issues with the frames (FPS). It usually hovers around 20-25, but when I'm building or farming, it's horrible and goes below 10 at times. Not sure if it has got to do with the configuration of my system or if there's a genuine problem behind it. I'm guessing it's my pathetic system.
Playing with friends has never been so fun. Since it's free and small and great, my small-budget friends can also fit in. I can't sleep at times just because I'm constantly thinking of what's required for that "perfect" base. It was different in the start, though. I found it tough to survive with zombies around in the first few hours. Now I find it tough to survive without them being around. Nothing beats the feeling when I smash their infested heads with my Sledgehammer feeling like Thor.
And after all this, I learn that the guy behind the game is a 17 year old. I'm 17 and I'm nowhere in life. Kudos to him, he's definetely pulled off something great. Give him the 5$. He actually deserves much more than that.

I love this game to bits; BUT PLS. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS PRECIOUS PLS MAKE AN AUTO STACK AND AUTO ORGANIZE OPTION IN THE GAME. I love to explore find things enjoy the scenery of the game but half of the time Im just nitpicking on my inventory because it's all so clustered and there's no option to organize them at all which would honestly be, one of the BEST additions you can make to this game.
Now I don't know if there are mods for that but it would be best if it would be made canon in game.
I love everything about this game and im looking forward to a lot more updates but please sincerely think about this suggestion I think it would benefit literally EVERYONE ,EVery Server, Every kid that cries when they are griefed. Every kid who enjoys a good open world survival but unfortunately has OCD (me)

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TL;DR
This game is a great sandbox survival game where you can construct houses, kill zombies, scavenge for supplies, store the stuff you find and in multiplayer modes, fight against or with other players for supplies and survival. The graphics are not the fanciest that can be found out there, but it's because of the pure and unique style this game has. A moderately complicated crafting system is also present. If you like survival MMOs, this game is for you. There's also a singleplayer mode for a more peaceful experience.
1. The Actual Review
When I downloaded this game, I wasn't really expecting much, especially because my brother recommended it and most of games he likes, I don't. But it was a huge blast when I noticed how complex and how challenging this game actually is, especially in multiplayer modes. You can carry both a primary and secondary weapon (in the beta version 3.0, which is way better than 2.5), which are basically a rifle/shotgun/assault rifle as a primary and a melee/pistol as a secondary weapon. You can also find clothes, helmets, backpacks, food, water, and did I say HELMETS?! and many more items that will help you to survive longer by providing more space to carry more items, healing and protection.
2. Pros and Cons
Pros
- Huge sandbox experience;
- Decent amount of items;
- Difficult to survive when you are not experienced;
- In multiplayer, you will actually do anything not do die because the death penalty is high (this can be a con for some, but I really love games where you are actually afraid of dying);
- The dev takes good care of the game and updates frequently with new content and fixes (about 3 times a week);
- Good crafting system;
- You can create your own maps;
Cons
- The community is generally friendly but can be annoying depending on the server you join;
- Singleplayer gets very easy and boring after some time;
- The beta branch of the game sometimes experience a few game-breaking glitches that are, most of times, solved quickly.
3. Personal Experiences
>Second day playing multiplayer, naked, because I died in the previous day;
>Some guys who like to play as cops at stratford point guns at me complaining I'm commiting a crime by walking naked;
>I get a death penalty
>A mysterious sniper takes down the tree guys from a distance and I leave the place alive
>Mysterious sniper turns out to be a guy with a farmer's hat and military gear
>He gives me some food, water and orders me to carry a few things for him
>Minutes later, after helping him out a bit, I find a swiss knife and hide it from the mysterious sniper
>Fearing he will kill me after I have a considerable amount of stuff, but no weapons and that he's using me as a packmule, I backstab him in the head
>get all his gear and he comes at me, naked and carrying a rifle a few minutes later
>Rek him again
10/10 would rek the mysterious sniper again
>After one week and recently dying, I have a supressed sniper and a few things;
>I see a group of 3 full-geared guys with nightvisions and rare military weapons;
>I take one out with a headshot and the others try to hind behind a tree, but they're still in my line of sight;
>I take the other two guys out and start being called aimbot by the whole group
>They start to say in the world chat where they died
>as I'm taking their gear, a guy that barely has clothes hits me with a sledgehammer in the head twice and I die
>I respawn and go desperately try to retrieve my stuff
>Give up when I notice there's about 15 players fighting for the loot with snipers, grenades and assault rifles
10/10 would start a war again
There were many other epic moments that I wish I could tell, but my review will get too long! Do get the game if you like this genre and don't get very mad when you die!

Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover // Recommended for fans of survival games - All fans, not just younger gamers
+ Boasts all of the staples of a typical survival game
+ Game engine runs very smoothly with blessedly few issues
+ Features multiple maps to explore & enjoy
+ The gameplay is surprisingly and, almost deceptively, nuanced & in-depth
+ Huge plethora & variety of weapons & items to loot
+ Base building mechanics are solid & reliable
+ Shockingly snappy & satisfying gunplay with an unexpectedly close attention paid to physics (e.g. bullet drop)
+ Farming mechanics are in full swing here, & are generally well-implemented overall
+ Multiplayer enjoys all the benefits of custom & private servers, including customization options galore
+ Skills add a welcome & functional RPG element
+ Steam Workshop support, which serves to prevent stagnation & encourage innovation
+/- Visual & audio design will not appeal to everyone, but to my mind both A) did not hold the game back at all, & B) add significantly to the game's charm
- Crafting is incredibly deep & nuanced, but feels like it lacks refinement

Pros:
Free to play
Base building
Crafting
Mild Farming
Large Maps
Workshop
Active dev
Multiplayer and Singleplayer
Vehicles you can drive, steal, and damage
Has a couple of wild, dangerous animals (bear/wolf)
Neutral:
Zombies (I like zombies but others may not)
Blocky style (it's not bad, but sometimes it does look a bit silly)
Cons:
Other players (it's not always bad, but some people take the raiding too far)
Possible cheating and/or people who abuse their power as the mod on a server
Kits and the like that turns the game into a spamfest
It's been a while for me, but I believe the Permanent Gold Upgrade also poses a mild issue. Where people with the upgrade can use their character slots as unraidable storage. Or when they die with one character, they can switch in their fully geared character to fight someone that beat them.
TL;DR: The game has some mild issues, but it's free and has an extremely active dev that constantly updates the game. Probably the best free2play game I've ever played, that didn't make me feel like it was trying to leech out all my money and my soul.

This game saved my life.
I am 25.
My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.
When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.
After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline broken. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.
Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my "labor". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.
Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.
I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.
Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.
Thank you.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Unturned is a PvE/PvP zombie survival game.
Summary
Like any zombie survival game is the goal in Unturned to build a big base and show dominance.
You loot villages, military bases, camping sites, farms, and more to find loot that will help you get stronger. However, whenever you go to these locations you may run into other players with the same idea. Will you attack them, sneak away or try to make an ally?
Pro's
Free to Play
Good replayability
Building a base is easy
Customizable weapons
Fun to play with and against friends
Dieing isn't very punishing as getting items doesn't take hours
Frequent updates
Workshop
Cons
Getting certain items you need in order to progress can be grind
You can get sniped by a camper and can do little against it
Destroying a base isn't hard at all
Offline raiding is easy
The community is mostly young kids
I would recommend this game when a friend can host a server where you have some rules to not base raid.
It can be a bit grindy, but if your friends are active its no big deal.
It's free, so why not give it a go?
