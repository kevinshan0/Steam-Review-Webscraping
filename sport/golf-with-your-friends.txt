EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Rage inducing Golf game, But super fun with friends, even with strangers!
The stupidity that you can do in this game, Play with a cone instead of a ball, An egg, a square, Change the gravity, Etc.
It's so frustrating!!! But not in a bad way!! In a good... Funny way...
This game is challenging, and very simple at the same time, Well.. Depending what room you join!
Once you get the hang of it, It's very easy, and a good game to make time go by if you're bored.
Honest Rating: 8.5
-1.5 Due to a couple of annoying bugs in the game that haven't seem to be fixed, and it's very annoying.
Sometimes you tend to go through the floor and unable to move, And then there is also MORONS who join the game that just... waste your time, It would be nice to have a kick option.. But okay...
Recommendable? YES.

Bought game expected to play with friends, but sadly no friends :(
Still fun with randoms tho very chill game if you need a break and the matches are pretty short.
The main downsides to the game is that if somebody is hacking/cheating the entire game will glitch and will destroy the map.
TL:TR Fun chill game but you don't get auto friends. :(

My Impression
Originally posted by FriendOfMine:
I never thought this game would actually be so much fun!
This pretty much sums it up.
You will hear so much swearing, cheering and laughing playing this game the way it's supposed to be played - with your friends.
TL;DR
Here is my shortcut - the hole in one of this review.
Positive	Mediocre	Negative
+ Pretty maps		
+ Different ways/paths to hit		
+ Custom Modifier		
+ Steam Invites		
	~ The UI could use an overhaul	
+ Zooming in and out is possible		
+ Free Camera	~ only 15 seconds per hole	
+ Relaxing Soundtrack	~ some might find annoying	
		- No Map Editor
The Gameplay
It's Golfing - as easy as it gets - you hold the mouse button, move the mouse to change the strength and direction of your shot and release to hit the ball.
Additionally, you can choose to play a kind of basketball, where jumping (default 'Spacebar') is enabled and the holes become hoops.
You can also zoom in and out to get a better idea of the location of your goal. Beyond that, even if something obscures your vision you can use the free camera (default 'C') to get a better idea of your position.
The Levels
Currently, there are 6 different levels: Forest, Desert, Moonlight Park, Spooky Mansion, Candyland and Jurassic Park.
Something I really enjoyed to see is the progression you can observe going from level to level.
Each map contains 18 holes and at least in the forest level you can finish it with 18 shots - but this will take a lot of practice.
The design is really neat and most of the time you can take more than one approach to hitting the ball.
With to the many possibilities comes a big part of the replay value and the whole fun of the game. If you manage that one insane hit, none of your friends even thought about and you leave them wondering how you managed the hole in 2 strokes when they are on the 7th.
Multiplayer
Creating and joining a lobby is super easy, as well as setting up modifiers.
Another big part of replaying this game will come from setting up different modifications - such as 'random ball shapes'. When the unlucky one with the acorn hits the hole in one - a ♥♥♥♥ storm will be unleashed :D
However before even going into multiplayer, I advise you to paint your ball under 'Customize' - so you can be recognized by your friends. Just don't take the same colors.
Pro tip: Press 'L' to light the way for your friends.
The Visuals
All the levels are really neatly designed and have a really cool air about them, to match a certain theme and bring you in the mood.
The Forest, for example, is an all outside map, with a timber mill and saws and rolling logs around the place.
The Desert features a pyramid theme with a sphinx and switches from an open-air level to an indoor level around the way.
Moonlight Park is the currently only night level which has a really different feel from the other maps, it's quite magical.
In the Spooky Mansion you will play all indoors and have ghosts spooking around as well as weird statues and trophies as well as cobwebs all over the place.
Candyland makes your sweet, sweet dreams reality, but giving you lollipops, jelly, cream and every delicious obstacle you could ever wish for on golf course.
Pretty much extinct, but not to confuse with dead boring is Jurassic Park where you will play with the bones of fallen dinosaurs and enjoy a fallen antic metropolis vibe.
The Sound
I really like the sweet melody in the background, my friend, however, turned the volume way down because he couldn't stand it - so it's really a preference thing.
The Verdict
If you have friends willing to play this game with you - by all means you can have a good time.
However, there isn't that much content in the game yet. Of course, you can aim for the hole in one on every map (if this is even possible; I don't think it is), hone your skills by trying new hits and playing with funny settings but it depends on how long you and your friends will stay motivated together - because if the first one loses the interest, the others will probably follow.
Also: always play with Collision - on. HateThank me later.
Note:
If you have read this far - thank you.
I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.

Posted: November 27, 2021
I have put many hours into this game with friends. No more.
Recently added spyware.
The latest patch, "Analytics Patch 1.2" added on by default tracking that reports home whenever you click online play. The game, regardless of enabled or disabled "analytics", breaks when blocking their spyware server (ads.t17service.com).
spyware : Software that secretly gathers information about a person or organization.
The software has an option to disable analytics, but still attempts to connect to analytics servers.
Regardless of being in (the default), or opting out of analytics, the game must connect to their analytics server to function.
I've opted out, and the game no longer functions.

NOW UPDATED WITH NEW SPYWARE BECAUSE TEAM17 DIDN'T LEARN THEIR LESSONS WITH INJECTING REDSHELL INTO EVERYTHING.
No.
I'm done.
If I could get a refund I would, because I am sick of this trend of injecting spyware into our games.
EDIT: I have been informed that EU law requires data collection to be OPT IN, not opt out. Thus, this product now violates EU law. I hope all EU players reports this product for now being in violation of EU law with the inclusion of this spyware.
EDIT: proof of mass data transfer from the newly injected spyware:

Absolutely hilarious if you have friends but if you don't, it makes you slide even farther down the slippery spiral of depression into a tranquil yet suicidal state at 3 A.M. where you silently cry your eyes out on the moldy carpet your parents never cared to replace, while the colors of the screen dance across your room, providing a stark contrast to the emptiness that is your soul.

Good, laid back game to play with friends. It might be even better than real mini golf because I don't have to go outside with my pale skin and worry about awkward social interactions. The different settings are fun to try and keep the game interesting, and the devs are always updating with new maps and fixing bugs. Keep up the great work guys!
Posted: January 18, 2017
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The game itself is really fun however the community of players is garbage,
Good:
The Devs of this game do a great job fixing problems, keeping people up to date, and adding new content. The game is actually really fun when your able to play and it's usually pretty stable for an early access game.
Bad:
The community. I understand the need to be able to kick a player due to ping problems or language however, this feature seems to get abused by hosts more often than used for its intended purposes. If you decide to join a random lobby instead of creating your own or playing with your friends, you better not be beating the host or you'll probably be kicked. Taking to long to line up your shots? You're probably gone. If you get somewhat good at the game (which you will because you'll learn the tricks to most holes) be prepaired to not finish games in random lobbies if you're beating the host.

Golf With You Friends Review.
Pros:	Cons:
Excellent developers.	May feel repetitive.
Many customization options.	No dedicated matchmaking.
Provides hours of entertainment.	Requires others for maximum enjoyment.
Fairly inexpensive.	
Amazing courses.	
Consistent updates.	
Multiplayer
Online multiplayer is becoming an increasingly important factor in my decision to purchase games. With that said, I feel multiplayer in this game is rather lacking. Golf with your friends doesn't provide a dedicated matchmaking system. It does, however, grant you the option to create custom lobbies effortlessly.
Summary
Overall, Golf With Your Friends is a solid game that is best played with others to maximize your entertainment. It contains an excellent development team that listens to the community and wants to improve the game drastically. The game is incredibly inexpensive at $5.99, and therefore if you have others to play with, I would highly recommend this game because it's quite enjoyable. If you intend to play solo, it may get repetitive fairly quickly, but is fantastic nonetheless.
General: 8.5/10

It's a lot of fun to play with your friends.
Your friends can sometimes make enemies with each other.
In todays day and age, you would think that a multiplayer game would have a basic function of allowing the player to rejoin an already started game if they lose connection due to internet trouble.
If you're in this situation, and you lose connection, you cannot rejoin your friends. You must wait until they a) finish the game or b) leave the game and reinvite you.
I do recommend this game, as it is a lot of fun when you play with your friends.
Never-mind the fact that this game is selling itself on playing with friends. To be playing a lovely round of golf with your friends, and for your friend(s) to get disconnected due to whatever reason, and that there is absolutely no possibility of them rejoining, is frustrating and just makes zero sense.
Incorporate this feature.
There is also an issue where, in some scenarios, the golf ball can become suspended in infinite air, whilst not moving. It appears as if the ball is on the ground, but in fact, it is floating. You can't reset the ball. Your only option is to forfeit the round and to add 14+ shots to your score-sheet.
Other than these two flaws. The game is a lot of fun. It has a couple of different game modes, such as hockey, and basketball. I don't think there are too many lads that are playing solo, however, you have your lobby on public and it will fill up over time.

Truly a remarkable mini golf game:
It's in early access, so I wasn't surprised by the lack of maps (only 2 available).
What I WAS surprised by, however, was both how smooth the gameplay is and how diverse the holes are. There is a colorful variety of custom options for the games, ranging from playing golf with cubes/eggs, to changing the gravity and changing how bouncy the balls are!
I strongly recommend everyone to get this game if they have some friends that they can play it with, as I can see how it would get boring by yourself....just like real-life mini golf :>

This game will awaken a new rage within you that are only spoken of in myths of old. After a night of golfing with my so called "Friends" the following i vowed never to speak to them. My wife mentioning that we should have them over for dinner. Hearing this sent me into a blind rage. Unable to recognize anyone or anything I set off on a path destruction across the neighborhood. I yelled at my wife which caused the dog to start barking causing me to strike the dog. Dan, my neighbor came over to investigate and was met with a swift slap to the face. The police where called and after an 18 hour stand-off and eventual trial and conviction I am serving out my time in state prison. Golf with Friends changed my life for better or worse. 10/10 would highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice relaxing night of fun with family or friends!

Positive:
Infinite amount of workshop maps to play from.
You can create and share your maps of course.
Golf ball customization (and hats).
Server/map settings to change how the game is played (gamemodes, jumping, ball size/shape, time limits, etc).
Multiplayer.
Negative:
The level editor definitely needs improvement, constant amount of bugs and positioning issues with items.
Overall, great mini-golf game that is backed behind a huge workshop community. Plus, you can wear a stack of pancakes as a hat.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
10/10 Golf with your Friends is honestly worthy of GOTY. Here's why;
Music: The music is mind-blowing for lack of better words. It is capable of giving you a wide arrange of fealings from happiness to legitimate depression and agony. I would absolutely recommend turning it up to max as you enjoy/scream through your game of Mini-Golf with your friends. The composer has truely accomplished a feat with the one repeating song that plays throughout the entire game.
Physics: The physics in this game are surprisingly realistic and fair. That is, unless you change them so you're on the moon. Which brings me to my next point.
Options/Customization: Do you not like your white ball? Change it to hot pink! Not like that you can't collide with your friends? Make it so you can! Not like the gravity? Drag a bar and take a trip to Mars! Not like being in 3rd Person? Use the scroll wheel to go into 1st Person mode! I was actually surprised with the amount of things you could change in this game, which is actually cheaper than the average sandwhich. Use that logic to convince your friends to buy this game so you don't have to play it by yourself. Trust me, It worked for me.
Overall Graphics: For an early access game this is top tier. Honestly. The screenshots aren't cutscenes, there actually aren't any cutscenes in this game, I mean it's mini-golf why would there be? All the screenshots are in game footage. Crazy huh?
It's Balanced: All the courses in this game are very well balanced, which suprised me since this is a golfing game. (aside for the ones you can access by turning on beta content, those need some work. Like ffs the Twilight map is hard af)
Blacklight Interactive has done something spectacular with this game and I cannot wait for the Bogey Boy DLC. Great work guys.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Get your friends in voice chat, randomize the settings, and have a blast. Every outcome makes for bizarre strategies (especially things like Low Gravity + Cube Golf Balls + High Bounce).
Spent almost six hours the first night playing with three friends and laughing ourselves to tears as things went absolutely pants-on-head ridiculous.
Can't recommend enough.
