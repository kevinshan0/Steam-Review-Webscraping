This game is a great time burner.
For years I waited for a game reminicent of Downhill Domination, this has filled that gap nicely.
I played it for free on Xbox Game Pass, then bought it for Steam so that I could play with mods.
Then I spent half my time on the game cruising through the two career paths and completing the sponsorship challenges.
And the other half Is spent just fooling around in the main lobby park. There you can watch others pull off tricks that you can learn or practice wheelies and nose manuals to the point of perfection. Just put some spotify on (or listen to the great built in soundtrack) and just practice. It's a great escape.
I remember being in the lobby and I saw someone just cruise by in a stable wheelie and just thought "huh, I wanna learn that" so over about a week, i perfected wheelie control.
Then saw someone do a 360 Backflip and thought, "I wounder if I could do that into a vert ramp" so I did.
Pulled off a nice 360 can-can? Now add a little no-hander or tweak at the end. Yeh nice.
Then I learned what jumps not to go for, which is half the challenge, you wouldn't go full steam at everything at a real bike park would you? You would die. And you will on this too.
This game is about finesse, make it to the bottom and clean land every trick, know what not to do on certain take-off ramps and learn how to recover when you look like you're going to mess it up. This is what it is all about.
I would say that once you have mastered all of the available trick combinations, it can get a bit same same, But then its up to you to learn how to turn those tricks into runs that deliver flow and finesse. Again, that's the real art of this game.
What is missing, and probably for the best, is chat. The only form of communication you have with others is to ding your bell or hoot your horn, or bunnyhop wildly in front of them to try to convey some kind of message.
But i do feel, that lack of chat is what keeps this game rage-free and troll-free. Although it would be good to compliment other players during runs to build the hype.
Overall, a fantastic game and with the mods and an active/talented mod community, this game will last a long time for me.

Don't download during the free weekend, it's a trap. You'll feel compelled to spend ten bucks.
TL;DR: Easy purchase.

This game made me want to try mountain biking in real life so I bought a $700 mountain bike and now I do it at least once a week. Highly recommend

Descenders is an amazing Downhill Biking game, You can go fast or go for the tricks, Customize your biker, Explore open levels or go for the random generated tracks, It is the ultimate Downhill game.
The game start with a nice tutorial where it explains the basics of riding the bike, The controls are done very nicely. From there you get into the main menu, Which is a small BMX park where you can see other players messing around, When you bike off the map you will explode and get launched back to the center, Looks very familliar :P
In the main menu/lobby there is a shed where you can customize your bike and rider, There are a ton of clothing parts, helmets, bikes, accessories, etc that you are able to unlock. You start with practically nothing, But you will unlock something after every ride, depending on your performance you can get rare stuff or more common stuff.
When you are done messing around at the park you can start anything by pressing the start button, Here you can launch The Career, Career Plus, Freeride or mods. Career is a mode where you have limited lifes, You lose 1 or 2 lifes if you crash, But you can gain lifes by completing the optional objective for every level.
It is the goal to find the exit level in each Biome, Each biome has a bunch of dots that all represent a level, You start at the beginning and every time you complete a level you can play the dots that are next to the completed dot. There are many different kinds of levels, You can complete them all, but the goal is to just find unlock and complete the exit level
The Exit level is usually an insane jump, so saving up some lifes might be usefull, You also gain perks that are active for the duration of your run, After you lose your last life you have to start over drom the beginning. You can start from selected biomes if you completed their main jump a few times, But you really miss out on the easy extra lifes in the earlier biomes.
Career Plus is the same as Career only it has 4 different, more challenging Biomes. Freeride is like a custom Career where you can modify the randomness of the run. Make it easier, make it harder, Whatever floats your boat. Then there are the mods, Which is just insane, They can be the same downhill challenges, Free Roam maps, Trial Bike Challenges, You name it.
Workshop support is brand new, But there are already a few nice maps, Like BikeOut, Which is WipeOut with a bike, It has checkpoints, Then there are like 5 insane skate parks and some other stuff, I am curious towards the insane maps people will build using this powerfull workshop support. I think we will see a lot of Trial bike Challenges.
The Entire game is online, Everywhere you look you see other players, How this works with the Random generation beats me, But I suppose they thought of something clever. If you don't like the idea of everyone seeing you crash over and over again you can choose to disable the online functionality.
The game also has a great soundtrack, And just stunning graphics, I think this is the best downhill game ever made. It could however use a better trick system, The LB + RJ is great, but there are only a few tricks that you can do with it. I would love to see more insane tricks that you could do for those biggest airtimes.
Overall the game is just amazing, I don't see anyone not liking this game. I have to give this game a solid 10, It truly has everything you could ask for in a biking game.

Buy this if you are interested in the idea of riding a bike down quick and short generated levels, risking your HP to do dangerous tricks and rack up score. Although the individual levels feel similar, if you beat the boss jump at the end you'll travel through up to 8 largely different biomes, unlocking shortcuts along the way (Spelunky style) to jump straight to the later biomes.
Some people buy this expecting an open world game or a game where you'll have to moderate your stamina and thirst, or changing the thickness of your tires and tinkering with the suspension of your bike; this game isn't that kind of simulation. Instead, Descenders is a really enjoyable arcade roguelite.

Probably my favorite game ever. I work in a very high stress job and there are days I just want to come home and game without investing a whole lot of thought into what I'm doing. I've done full runs from highlands to peaks, desert to glaciers. Unlocked all shortcuts, and have gotten over 10m rep. All of that has been reset twice, and I did it again and loved every minute of it.
I even had a problem when I switched from Nvidia to AMD gpu, bunch of programs I had for Nvidia were causing issues with a few games. The other games I just uninstalled. But I spent a few hours figuring out how to get this one to work, emailed Lex etc. Ended up modifying the code so it would only open in some default offline mode, played like that until I figured out the root cause.
Never been a fan of racing games and other sports games like Skate don't appeal to me these days. But man, everytime I take a break for a bit and jump back in, I can just play for hours and hours day after day.
Buy this game, the value is great.

Amazing game! always wanted to play this type of game on Steam, if they add multiplayer mode that would be much better , do u guys agree with that ?

Hey! If you enjoy short and sweet reviews, follow my curator page here![store.steampowered.com] I am an independent Curator providing reviews and insights to the games that need the spotlight! Thank you! :) 
The only two things you should know about this game are:
1. It has the potential to be THE game of the genre. Yes, finally a successor for Downhill Domination!
2. The music in this game is RAD!
The graphics are amazing, the animations are well crafted and it is always a fun experience; for the casual gamers who want their 20 minute fix or if you want to spend your time with it.
It is in Early Access still but the updates are consistent and the developers respect their public. Just for that reason alone they need your support! Make sure you give this one a go.
2020 UPDATE: The game is out of Early Access and I can finally say we have the successor for Downhill Domination!!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Huh, where do I start. The game is amazing, hands down the best (and probably the only? haha) downhill game there is. And boy does it deliver. Ever since I bought it its pretty much the only game I play with, as an avid mountainbiker myself its really like a dream come true with this game. I've been waiting for something like this for 15 years, and its friggin amazing.
Even though its early access it already feels like a finished game, and the devs constantly working on it, listening to community feedback as well, and literally, you can have a chat with them on discord. If you like mountainbiking you gonna love this game.
Posted: June 24, 2020
What can I say? It's just amazing! I love the calmness of this game and I love the fact that I can completely lose myself playing this. It also has the best OST I've ever heard. It does everything Steep does, but better and even more! Absolutely amazing. Only downside is that there is no way to chat with people. 9/10 amazing game.

Descenders is a hidden gem on the steam market for downhill/MTB fans. Go Wild on different locations such like green mountains or the canyons and others. Perform red bull worthy tricks before you land

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Ok, where do I start, for starters I'm an actual downhill rider, and I was longing for a decent and playable mountain biking game. I randomly looked again on steam and stumbled upon Descenders, instantly bought the pre-access after seeing the trailer video.
Let's start with the game
- Very fun gameplay mechanics, a little hard to begin with but gets better with training, the learning curve was actually not frustrating at all and the controls have a very good potential and are responsive and well balanced.
- Physics are good. For an game under development, this is really good actually. The feeling of speed is spot on, and the tricks are fun to land and feel satisfying.
- The freaking helmet cam. Let's talk about that. It's insane and I want it as an option to switch during my runs as I please! It's insane, the feeling of not seeing how you're gonna land a trick, and the feeling of having to lean back during a backflip is just SPOT. ON. I loved that, and I'd love that as an option to switch to. Actually got some adrenaline playing with this mode.
- The career system. Absolutely sweet, maps change after every career ending, you get to choose your type of terrain and track, steep & curvy, curvy & stunty, steep & stunty. Love that approach. Limited number of retries is good too.
- The Shed, needs some more development but it's looking good already. Being able to customize your bike and rider is a great.
I can't recommend this game enough to mountain bikers who like downhill riding and throwing tricks/slopestyle riding. The game is very arcade-ish and casual, no time-consuming quests or levels of some sort. Just riding, and that's what I loved about the very little time I already spent. All my time was spent riding and nothing else.
Another suggestion: should definitely add dirt jumping/slopestyle modes, with more tricks like tailwhips and so on !
Thank you for this very well made game. Can't wait for more development and updates.

It's the Skate 3 of Mountain Biking games 😍
10/10 Definitely recommend!
Posted: August 13, 2020
This game is a great way to turn off your brain and have fun for 45 minutes at a time. It does a great job of making you feel the speed and the curves and the height of your jumps.
Absolutely recommended. If you're on the fence but you think it looks pretty fun, go for it -- it's a really fun game.

Unfinished game. It's missing the entire last half where you're in the hospital and you have to deal with your mother standing over your bed judging your life choices that led you to bike through a forest at 30 miles an hour and then try to ramp over a moving train. This is a basic part of the game that's been left out, these guys are worse than Nintendo
Posted: February 24
If you're at the point of reading reviews to try to decide whether or not to buy this game, I'm assuming you find yourself in the same dilemma I found myself in: Should I buy Descenders or Rider's Republic? I wanted a downhill biking game and it was such a hard decision. Well, luckily I own both, so I can compare them side by side so you don't have to. I'll just copy+paste my review on both so you can compare the two without purchasing both. (Or, heck, DO buy them both. They're both EXCELLENT games in their own regard, with each of them having unique things that make them 'stand out' from the other.)
So without further ado, Descenders vs Rider's Republic.
Q. Which one 'feels' more like biking? Which feels more natural?
A. Hands down, Descenders. I don't know what it is, but I've never played a biking game where the riding just felt absolutely natural and 'right.' Don't get me wrong, the riding in RR is still great, but there's something about the flow of D that makes it feel like you're actually riding a bike. (Also, RR, despite being loads of fun, can feel a little glitchy at times.. and occasionally, if my Steam Deck lags a little, my rider will come to a dead stop in a heartbeat... which is somewhat problematic in a game all about maintaining high speeds.) In D you will feel the trails, feel the speed, feel the jumps. It feels right.
Q. Which has more to do in the game?
A. Hands down RR. I'll speak a little more about D in a bit, but let's be real here: RR has bikes, skis/snowboards, wing-suits and more (and skating if you buy the DLC's). There are all kinds of side quests in RR, different types of races, all kinds of goals and achievements... It is an open-world setting, and that world is filled with things to do. In contrast, while the levels in Descenders are large, the only kind of 'open world,' so to speak, are the lobbies and the multiplayer arenas (where you can't gain Rep).
That's not to say there's nothing to do in D. You can mess around in the lobby with other players, you can go on adventurous rides, conquer boss jumps, and pull off great stunts. You can go play in the multiplayer worlds. There's plenty to do - it's just not filled to the brim with content like RR.
However - it needs to be said that sometimes quality vs quantity is a thing. Maybe more on that next.
Q. Which has more VARIETY?
A. That's right - although RR has a TON of stuff to do, it HAS to be pointed out that Descenders' levels are procedurally-generated, so each time you go on a ride your paths will be different. Now, it's not so different that you'll feel like you're in a different world every time.. but the paths ARE different enough that it will absolutely keep you on your toes. You can't attempt to 'memorize' the paths like you can with RR. You'll ABSOLUTELY have to establish some real flow in D.
Q. Which has better graphics?
A. This one is VERY hard. While RR is an enormous game filled to the brim with details, there's something extremely beautiful about D as well. Both of them have highly detailed worlds, and each one has their own 'feel' to them. Descenders makes you feel like you're in this lonely, far-away natural world, while Rider's Republic makes you feel like you've gone on vacation to a huge park of sorts filled to the brim with people. The 'world' seems to flow a little more naturally in D, while the cuts between biomes in RR can sometimes feel a little abrupt. I don't know if there's a clear winner on graphics - despite RR having way more assets, the simple beauty of D has its own stunning appeal. I think this one will just be a matter of opinion for each player.
Also has to be said that it can take a bit of a beast to run RR at full settings. My Steam Deck seems to be able to handle most graphics-intensive games fairly well, but I actually had to turn down the settings on RR just a little because I was losing FPS and it was getting glitchy.
Q. Which has more multi-player/better function?
A. Probably RR, although the multi-player in D still adds a lot of fun. In D you can ride around with others in the lobby, go to multiplayer worlds full of random stuff, and encounter other players out on the trails. Far as I'm aware, that's about it. Out on the trails you're not really racing others, but it's still cool to encounter them.
Meanwhile, in RR, there are 'mass races' with 50+ other players (although I'm pretty sure there are plenty of players who are able to cheat), you can challenge others, etc. So yes, there's a lot more competition in RR. It's also a little more seamless in RR - in D, players have a tendency to 'glitch' and fly all over the place. Both are fun, but if multi-player competition is extremely important to you, probably RR.
Q. Which has more 'stuff' to get?
A. No clue. I have LOADS AND LOADS of 'stuff' in D. Bikes, accessories, shirts, pants, helmets, it seems like there is just no end of customization stuff to get in D. Meanwhile, in RR, I have plenty of 'stuff' like bikes, skis, snowboards, wingsuits, and all kinds of garbage... but very little in the way of clothes and accessories. Crappily, it seems that if you want clothes or things like that, you've got to actually purchase (like, with real money) in-game currency to spend. I have no desire to spend money on clothes. That stuff should be won by playing, just like in D. Seems greedy of RR.
One difference is that in D, the different 'bikes' are mainly just skins, whereas the different gear in RR actually have their own performance stats. So this is again a matter of opinion - if you like things to be fair and be more about skill, you'd prefer D, where everyone's bikes are on a more equal playing field... if you want to have the 'fastest gear around,' then I guess RR.
But remember, again, there are TONS of things to be had in D, and a lot of stuff in RR that is locked behind a paywall. It will be up to you to decide how you want to play it.
Q. Better music/sounds?
A. No clear winner. I don't usually like in-game music so I often turn music in games off, but in both of these games I leave it on. The music in D gives you more of that 'I'm riding with determination in some far-off and lonely world,' while the music in RR tends to give more of that 'woo-hoo, I'm riding like crazy in this adrenaline-junky world filled with people.' Each on has their own appeal.
For the sound effects, I prefer the ones in D. Once again, they just feel more natural. (Despite being a somewhat smaller production, there's actually a lot about D that just feels more 'natural.')
Q. Which has a better 'reputation' system?
A. IDK. Each one has a 'reputation' system where you can show off your skill in the game... It's REP in D, and 'stars' in RR. I'll say that the rep of other players is a lot more visible in RR. You of course earn rep and stars by doing well in the game.
Q. Which one has more daily/seasonal events?
A. RR. D has a 'daily run' which can be a lot of fun, but I hear that a lot of folks are able to cheat and get billions of points or whatever. (But then again, from some of the races I've done on RR, I am almost certain there's cheating there as well.) Meanwhile, there are always a ton of on-going events in RR.
Q. Is there a clear winner between the two?
A. Not for me. I play both. When I feel like playing with a ton of variety or against other players, I'll switch over to RR. When I want an experience that feels just about as natural as it can get, I switch over to D. When I want to try to earn the fastest/best gear, I'll play RR... when I want to win an enormous variety of customization, I'll play D. When I want a more open world 'free play' style I'll play RR.. when I just want to go through procedurally generated series of levels I'll play D. I really do believe that each game has its own unique strengths and weaknesses.
Q. Worth full price?
A. Wait for a sale if you can. But for either one, they're both fantastic, so it wouldn't be the end of the world to buy at full price.

Descenders is absolutely incredible!
You can play and progress in this "rogue-bike" any way you want to whether it's fast or slow, off-road or on a path, simple tricks or intricate ones or even no tricks at all. It can be pretty relaxing since it has an incredible soundtrack and amazing visuals. The mechanics are top notch and playing with a controller makes you feel like you're a pro at the game even if you're slamming into trees half the time. Also the devs constantly add free content over time like bike parks, challenges/missions, and unlockable cosmetics so that's really enjoyable.
This game is a masterpiece, and I absolutely recommend it!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Descenders is a game that I really want to like. It's a cool concept, feels good to play, has a chill soundtrack, and looks nice most of the time. The problem is that the game's structure actively fights against the gameplay.
This game's career mode is set up to be a rogue-like (rogue-bike?) which means you're racing randomly generated courses. If you crash you'll lose health, lose it all and you're sent back to begining of the game. This means that you'll be playing the early levels over and over again before getting to see later environments but the bigger problem is that every run is very samey. It also encourages really careful gameplay so you don't bail and lose health when these games are made the most fun when flying down a mountain busting out crazy tricks. You can build a team which gives your rider perks but none of them are very interesting or run changing. Rogue-likes live and die by how different and crazy runs can get and perks that simply tweak stat numbers or terrain generation aren't very fun.
The courses themselves are all VERY short (usually under a minute) and they're all slopes with the same obstacles used over and over again. Everything is procedurally generated which means you'll never experience crazy cliffs or unique obstacles or anything that games like SSX and Downhill Domination excelled in. The lack of authored content makes it so no run feels truly special.
There's also a real lack of bonus objectives to earn back health and the Boss Jumps at the end of runs are more frustrating than fun. Overall the package just feels really shallow right now but I'm hoping the devs will make enough changes to it through Early Access to draw me back in.

Every time I click on this game to leave a review I end up playing it instead.
Posted: December 22, 2019
Why did nobody tell me this existed.
Posted: September 8, 2022
This is a great game on sale for people who like the idea of downhill freeride biking and people who are content with roguelites & their progression. If you LOVE downhill biking, you will love or hate this game because of its procedural generation, as the courses & lines may not "flow" like IRL riders expect.
I have been looking for some bike or motorcycle game, then I happened to come across this in a Humble Bundle, and this might be the most fun I've had with a bike based game (admittedly few of which I've played).
I highly respect this studio going from a on-rails butt-scooting runner racing game (Action Henk) to this more hardcore procedural freeride sporty game.
Here is what you need to know:
+This is a roguelite in that when you run out of health it is game over, you have any/all abilities from the start (aside from buffs), each area is an exploration "dungeon" of 30+ courses, that you can move freely among.
?The only things you can earn between runs are different wearable items. You can get a sponsor for your rider that allows you to earn specific things. There are also a few some tour type goals that I'm not sure if they're glorified achievements or not.
+Lots of different modes aside from roguelite careers, including free riding and daily challenges.
+So much of the game allows online players to play at the same time, though thankfully you can't collide with players because they are treated as ghosts. The game can be played offline though.
+Freeriding and staying on the track/trail seems well balanced, as off trail freedom comes with risks of obstacles such as trees & rocks.
+The end of EVERY playthrough, failed or not, gives new wearables.
+Visuals are fine, but texture resolution could be better, though no really noticible pop-in.
+Drum & bass music is banging - Well suited to my electronica inclined music tastes.
-Controller is highly recommended, as I couldn't figure out keyboard controls, and tutorial was for controller only.
?Great starting tutorial, but only advanced moves not in the tutorial can be referred back to again. Controls can be seen through button mappings and shows the general controls. Having grabs use the same d-stick as jumping takes some getting used to.
?How much you like the proc gen levels really comes down to how much you enjoy the challenge and the riding itself. The more of those 2 things you enjoy, then the less jaded you will be about things seeming the same. To help though...
?In-run buffs are unlocked by mechanics that you can choose from as you gain various amounts of Rep (like XP) for doing tricks, generally one per several courses. These carry over between areas in the same career run.
?Once an area's boss jump goal is completed the first few times (it change after each completion) then you can start/shortcut to the next unbeaten area instead of replaying the first. If second or later area is too hard, then the player can either start with an earlier area in order to build buffs, practice more in the later area, and/or choose one of 3 different bike structures (independent of bike skins/styles) with slightly different stats.
?The health system is seems fair. If you bail/wipeout, you lose 1 health, and if the bail is really bad then you can lose multiple points of health. Extra health can be gained from either certain courses or accomplishing generated bonus goals on any course such as doing a certain amount of hangtime, number of moves, beating a completion time, etc.
+The number of course mutations (aside from bonus goals) and the variations in course stats of steepness, curves, and stunts within an area/region are reasonable.
?First region is easiest in that nearly all trails can be done at full speed. Second region is tougher such that the curviest sections require slowing down using slides or even brakes. There are mechanic buffs that can help a little with these extra challenges.

If you want to get the best experience of BTT , that's the probably the best one for the price point
Advantage
+ Great to play with xbox one controler
+ Great customization
+ Crossplay with xbox players
Disadvantage
- Awful to play with keyboard
- Multiplayer it's kinda of bad , always need to create a new lobby every time you finish the game or even dying on the game
- Map's are to short

Posted: February 17, 2023
Yes and No.
7.4/10
Results may very, but overall this is fun casual game for any lover of bicycle/mountain bike riding.
Casual is an apt word to describe this game. It's quite good for a quick session every now and then. The overall game world is farely generic and doesn't really grab me. But the mechanics make up for this in my opinion.
The procedural generation keeps the challenge going with random maps, but this strength is also a weakness as the tracks lack flavor and the art assets get repetitive. I can tell the devs put love into the game, so respect to them. There have been some solid updates along the way too.
They made a good game, not great, but good.
1. Must play with a controller for the complete experience
2. Sense of speed and danger is top notch, riding mechanics are solid
3. Overall vibe is a little bland, no "it" factor
Posted: November 30, 2021
If you enjoyed roguelike and/or extreme sports games, you will love this game. The game is just straight up fun. This is not a racing game, it's a freeride downhill biking game. You can choose whether you played it safe or take the risk to do the crazy stunts you want to do. The prodecural generation always made this game never stale. You could choose which stages and upgrades that you want. The limited lives also made sure that you always on your toes since if you lost all of it you will lost all of your upgrades are gone. The career mode can be beaten in 45 minutes or more if you know what are you doing. The developer is also constantly updating this game with new stuff like cosmetics or new bike parks or even a whole new challenges. Even without the updates the modding scene is quite alive. This is really one of the best biking games to have ever existed.

When I first finished the game I thought to myself that the game was quite boring. Regardless I kept coming back and damn this game is addictive - Perfect mix of bike simulator and a rougelike. All my praise to Turbosquid for making this masterpiece and keeping it fresh with updates.
Posted: April 7, 2021
The gameplay reminds me of skate 3 where I can just jump in and goof around or i can actually follow the campaign its addictive and fun with anything you do and if you have friends who play it, it makes it 10x better ive never put 100 hours into a game without noticing. This game is by far one of my favorites on steam

This game is groundbreaking, with incredible graphics and a great gameplay feel.
*There are 10 worlds to explore (2 hidden worlds Volcano & Ridges)
*There are hundreds of items to collect
*You can even create your own paths in an editor if you want.
*There is also multiplayer so you can play with your friends, if you have any that is? But otherwise there are a lot of people in the game that you can join and have fun with.
* There are big bike parks in the game aswell.
Do you like mountain biking and doing tricks and riding very fast? Then this game is for you!

Finally, an MTB game to outshine Codemasters MTB racing games for the PSX and PSII!
You name it and this game has it, excellent solo gameplay over multiple modes and sweet multiplayer racing to get your heart pumping
If (and it's a small if) I was forced at gunpoint to be picky I'd say that separate brake controls for front and rear wheels would be the crushed macadamia nuts on top of a giant awesome sundae 9.99999999999999999999/10!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Descenders is *outstanding*. Wow, I am quite blown away by how great this whole thing is. It's brilliant, really. You take the progression structure from FTL and slap a downhill racer game on it. I cannot stress enough how well the risk/reward mechanic works here. And the whole thing is just visually beautiful, too.
Essentially, you only have so much life as you tear down procuedurally generated trails. Each bail takes so much life away, depending on how severe the crash was. You get within-run buffs that you choose, such as less curves, wider trails, less weather effects, tighter trick turning, and much more. There is one goal per track, and if you meet it, you get +1 to your health. It works perfectly. And then there are metagame unlocks such as gear.
This game is just so much fun to play. They encourage you to play using your own style, and it really does work. You can take it easy and be super cautious, or you can just shred down the mountain and rack up serious points. The tutorial did a great job of teaching the basics, but there are advanced features to master as well.
Pros:
+The game structure and mechanic are truly brilliant and as fresh as it gets
+The settings are visually beautiful
+The gameplay is really smooth, fun, and easy to get into
+The music is perfect
+Metagame leveling up and unlocks create a great way to keep players coming back for more
Cons:
-None that I have found
Well worth full price, period. This is one of those crazy ideas that just works oh-so well.

I really like the game but I wish that it will become Co-Op and add some new bike frames in the futre, we all know what bike this is, Polygon Colosus, but I really wish for a bike that looks like the YT Tues or a Demo 8.
That would make the game way better, in my oppinion :)
I mean is the same frame but with diffrent skins.

as a former downhill mountain biker and life time gamer this is the game I have been waiting for. Everything about the game currently is great. 51 hours into the game I have pretty much done everything except unlock the last achievement ( do a full run with out crashing ) I am really enjoying the daily challenges but feel it is time for more.. what i would really like to see in this game is
1 a daily time trial on a random once off track
2 multiplayer, 4 cross racing, short wide tracks with jumps and obstacles with 4 players racing
3 another enviroment or two
4 the soundtrack is getting tedious now, would be nice with some more songs or be able to play your own music if not streaming...
none the less a fantastic game and really excited to see where it goes

Posted: January 19, 2020
I really like this game. It should be a 10/10
It hurts to give it a thumb down. But with some fixes, it will be great!
Why must it be THAT FRUSTRATING?
With those random generated trails, it will never get boring, true. But at the other hand it makes it less enjoyable. You can't memorize anything, so you can't optimize your track and find your preferred path. You must slow down your run to not loose health, And you need a lot of health for end bosses.
Then those random generated "additional goals" sometimes do not fit the generated trail and can not be achieved unless you loose some health. The end bosses are very hard to complete and the way to get there is boring, frustrating and too time consuming.
- Please give me more options in the way of difficulty settings (easy, hard, very hard etc). Lower difficulty = less reputation, but easier trails. Higher difficulty = more reputation, cool item drops etc.
- Please fix the stunts so they are manageable. Some at the mountain map are unpassable. Some cant be completed at lower speed (and you dont know you need speed, because its a random obstacle placement).
- Please fix those obstacle where you just fly into air and can not land properly, because its too high.
- Please fix the end bosses. They sometimes cant be completed at lower speed from last checkpoint (eg. Pyramid 360)
- Please add a button to quickly restart a session. If I fail at the first run, i really want to restart the whole session and do not prefer to lower my health to death first (takes me 1 min of stupid falling off my bike)...
- Please give me some teammembers that we can choose from at the start of the session and unlocking better ones while playing.
- Where can we train the map "Cunstruction area"? Its freaking insane.
- When it's night, why is it not changing to daylight again? Once night, always night?
Thanks developers to consider some of those fixes.
Greetings

There are some very real Downhill Domination vibes while playing this game and I am LOVING it! :D
Definitely my favorite trick and free ride game on Steam at the moment.
The racing is fun but not what I purchased it for.
CONS: I really only have two cons but they are big ones...
1.) **EDIT** THIS CON IS NOT TRUE. YOU CAN IN FACT SET SPAWN POINTS DURING FREE PLAY! Cannot set spawn point during Free Play. This means you are guaranteed to spawn at 1 of 4 spawn locations no matter where you crashed. This is very sucky because if you find a really fun spot and crash, you have to ride all the way back to that spot to try again. Crashing is exciting and part of learning, but being unable to set a spawn point to repeat said learning is NOT okay.
2.) There is NO way to go in reverse, AKA take your feet off the pedals and walk the bike back a few steps. This makes it very difficult to properly line up your bike and get it in the right position to do the tricks and free roam the way one would like.
All in all, Descenders is a great game and if this con I listed is addressed it would be perfect for open world tricking and riding.

This game is my new relax/kill time game. I've had my eye on it for the past year, picking this up was the best decision and WELL worth it's regular price and FOR SURE worth it when on sale. Super addictive, easy to pick up but hard to master gameplay. No transactions, plenty of content, great developer support, and a dedicated player base. Great soundtrack to accompany you in the forests while riding your bike enjoying the beautiful views. Definitely worth checking out, support this game!

As one of the biggest liquicity fanboys in the world
The soundtrack is the best thing ever <3
The game is also fun, and quitte easy to pick-up, runs pretty well and looks quiite decent (for an indie game)
__________________
- Progression in the game is weird
While unlocking items for your rider is okay, there is a whole lot of backtracking older locations to earn checkpoints (by clearing the last bossjump which is every time the same per stage)
To save lives for the later levels i kinda tend to avoid trick opportunities, which is kinda sad and i don't think the developers that that in mind
Because if you fall 5 times, you not only lose a boatload of points, you also have to start all over again from the last checkpoint, and lives do keep counting across stages (you can earn them again by completing challenges, but since doing those can also make you lose 1 or 2 lives..... )
You get what i mean
- The physics what you can expect from an arcade game
- The graphics are decent, but nothing to write home about, Ansel support is nice tho
- The game also runs well.

Pretty fun game all around. Its not simlike at all so dont expect a lot of realism. Its not overly arcadey either like you would have seen in games like SSX tricky. You do tricks but they are flips and spins. There is an extreme feeling of speed on the downhill steep tracks , so much so that I cant get down them most of the time. So there is a learning curve with using the steering with skids at big speeds. Also plenty of courses with minor steepness so you arent always out of control.
Its great to see a game come along with biking and be a lot of fun done correctly. Like I said its not a simulation but it is a lot of fun. Excited to see where they take things as development goes on.
Ill also say this isnt so much a traditional racing game, its more of a obstacle course/survive till the end game. With the procedural generated courses it is impossible to have timed leaderboards since no one is ever on the same course so there is nothing to compare times on/with. It still feels like racing in the heat of the moment. You have to remind yourself that speed isnt always the point when you are faced with just finishing being a challenge on some of the hard courses.

Great arcade game & run fine on Linux

This game gives me gives me hope for a Downhill Domination 2. My only complaint is that it could use more wacky customization and different tricks to pull off.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Descenders is one of those rare gems that comes by once a blue moon and leaves you wanting more. Descenders is a high speed all out downhill MTB game that reminds me of Downhill Domination way back on PS2 yet takes all aspects of that game and makes a great improvment on what was once thought as the best MTB game to date.
Each area of the game is seperated by a different biome such as Highlands, Forest, Canyon, and Peak. You start with Highlands which does not have many obsticles and guides you on how the game will play. As you progress through the game you will unlock more areas and it will keep getting harder and harder as you progress. Each area also has a "Boss Jump" at the end which will test your skills and the only way to progress is to clear the jump, which is easier said than done.
If I had only one complaint it is that the trick system is a bit lacking, you have flips and spins yet there is not off bike tricks such as supermans, tail whips, bar spins, etc. Yet overall the game is well worth the money and with the randomly generated worlds you will never have the same path twice and even sometimes they will throw in a full curve ball and really shake things up with night maps, fog, rain, heavy snow, etc.
I give the game a solid 9/10 and plan on putting many more hours into it. BUY IT!

Extreme thrillseeking.
Descenders is an intense stunt-biking game with procedural level generation. Thrust into the seat of a bike, players must survive treacherous landscapes and catch the biggest thrills, whilst trying to avoid being pasted against the ground.
Take in the scenery at over 60 miles per hour.
It’s a looker, this one. I especially commend the boosted saturation which makes everything pop on-screen, and enhances contrast in most situations. From lush, flowing highlands to snow-covered peaks, at first glance it’s a pretty title. However, procedural level generation has its shortcomings: the stages aren’t very populated with detailed objects, while the terrain presents several odd tessellation artifacts in raised corners and ridges. Ground textures are mostly serviceable, though some degree of tiling is apparent, and post-processing is on the mixed side – moving object blur extends beyond its confines, leading to smearing wheels, and depth-of-field is sudden with little ramp-up. There’s also something up with the fog effect, as distant terrain looks gray through the haze - most jarring when in bad weather conditions.
Ah, but while it might not look quite the best, it does run really well. A locked 60fps at 1440p on my Ryzen 9 3900X, 64GB RAM, 1070 Ti, Windows 10 Pro system, and on all graphical settings cranked to the max – no stability issues to report.
Amen break your bones.
To keep the gushing short, the soundtrack is two hours of licensed, liquid drum-and-bass provided by the record label Liquicity, and the zen-like atmosphere it provides is absolutely brilliant. It does, sadly, become repetitive, moreso if one does not enable the “shuffle music” option; each region otherwise only plays a small set of the music. Voice acting is very limited, with the most you ever get being your rider’s cheers, whistles and grunts whenever you either nail wicked tricks, or fail spectacularly at them. And when you do fail, the simple yet effective crunch sound effects will let you know how badly it hurts them.
A bit harder than riding a bicycle.
Though the header isn’t to say it feels bad to control. At least with a gamepad it’s nice; keyboard controls might need rebinding when they’re so complex as to almost require three hands. Be mindful of the absence of a dedicated reverse function – if you end up facing the wrong way, you’ll have to do hops and turn in place.
Anyway, fittingly for a bike, you can perform all kinds of stunts with relative ease, especially when aided by ramps, a bunny-hop, and a good bit of speed. It’s the fact there’s very little protection from impacts or bad landings which makes surviving difficult. You’re more than welcome to do a moon-jump and flip dizzyingly through the air with such flair that even your rider cheers, or attain such a velocity as you shoot through the trees, that your eyes water from the fantastic sense of speed.
Huge air, huge danger

Eyes on the path as you soar at literal breakneck speeds. The faster you go, the more tricks you can score and the more rep you can earn... so long as you don't crash horribly.
Mistakes hurt, and Descenders makes sure you know it. Your rider’s fairly fragile on multiple accounts. As stupid as it is to gently reverse into a beam and suddenly crumple over in a groaning heap, it’s also quite harrowing to see your available health dwindle down with each impact – and bigger wipeouts cost far more of your limited resource. Couple this with much of the game highly incentivizing you to not play safely, and let’s just say you’d better be prepared to get “rekt” repeatedly. It’s never truly unfair, as much of one’s bails can be attributed to overextension or skill than actual level design, but the stage generation does tread a fine line in that regard.
Better be careful of your speed and whether you commit to stunts. Otherwise, let's say things will hurt...

The regular career spans four environments, with multiple stages to traverse and pick from. An alternate career, labelled as “Career Plus”, has a very similar progression in significantly different levels. Almost every track is procedurally generated, with different properties such as steepness or the density of stunts, in addition to other modifiers that can impede vision or traversal. That aforementioned health can also be replenished by completing secondary objectives on each route, which comes at a considerable risk, like with many other things in this title. Also, a small number of nodes are fixed in design and carry unique secondary objectives, such as reaching a flag perched atop a construction yard.
A true descender!
Successfully clearing boss jumps, located at the end of each biome, helps unlock shortcuts to later levels. This can act as good practice for the deadly challenges that await your rider. Meanwhile, score enough rep in a single run and you can hire additional crew members from a random pool, to boost your riding capabilities, change up terrain generation, or scout additional stages and prevent negative modifiers. The balance of the crew members is a little dubious, as rarely does scouting prove useful, while enhanced bike riding is most valuable.
Outside of career modes, there is the option to generate a level with custom parameters, participate in once-a-day leaderboard runs on career biomes, enjoy specific multiplayer lobbies, or venture through custom bike parks. The last one is most interesting, given their more free-form nature and lack of penalties or risks to your overall goal of reaching the finish line. Also, the Bike Out series of parks are supremely difficult obstacle courses.
Your rider looks dull? Deck him out in all manner of sensible or zany attire and accessories. Invisible bike and bouquets? Sure, go nuts.

Long term goals revolve, one way or another, around customization. You’re drip-fed clothing or accessory items after each run – win or lose rekt, and for completing various milestones. A color picker for the many palette swaps of clothes would’ve been nice, but even with that small complaint there are a ton of items to earn throughout your playtime.
Helping with that are the sponsorships, and the Grand Tour. With the former, completing specific daily goals bumps you through a team’s tiers and showers you with goodies. Meanwhile, the Grand Tour encompasses everything about the game’s mechanics and offerings, and also rewards with even more stuff. The rarest stuff, of course, is awarded only for scoring massive rep on your runs.
A full career run, without dying, can be done in as little as two hours, but it is only a small part of the game. Its content can easily stretch to beyond 20 hours.
An extreme thrill.
Descenders is a splendid sports game. Breakneck speeds and dizzying stunts await those with a love for freestyle, an addiction to danger, and a gamepad.

The best bike game ever built.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Pros:
* Bikes are fun to ride, good handling and controls
* Good variety of tracks due to proc gen
* Lots of outfits
* Good DnB soundtrack that is easy to chill out and ride to
* Devs are active and have fixed many issues already (fixed bad proc gen geometry, added audio feedback for when you have too much air to land safely without a perfect landing)
Cons:
* Performance bugs that require game restart to fix, and if you alt-F4 out it'll just reload the same track and often the same bug will recur, you have to leave your campaign and forfeit points.
* Proc Gen occasionally makes tracks that feel unfair or very boring. Courses with 0-2 steepness are boring and also make it hard to get enough speed for certain jumps/obstacles, or it will put an uphill right before a jump, or a tight turn right after a big jump. Sometimes I think I would prefer 10-15 great handmade tracks vs 10^12 tracks of mixed quality.
* Punishing point system (Devs plan to revamp, it is Early Access after all)
Recommendations for devs:
* Add a favorite seed option so that people can have a stable of favorite generated courses to revisit later
* Make it easier to see the landing area flags of the gap jumps on Peaks
* Maybe a track builder?
* Way too easy to hit your head on Firewatch towers in Forest
* That one railed walkway thing on Peaks always has a huge drop after it, too hard to land correctly.
* No points for jumping Forest logs besides the air you get?
* Stunts rating for a track affects both stunts and obstacles, so sometimes you think you are gonna get a bunch of sweet jumps and instead you spend the whole track jumping logs and trying to fit between two rocks. More jumps on Forest please!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys singleplayer arcade style games as this game has fun physics and good controls however the key bindings cannot be changed which is a big let down especially because instead of 'A' and 'D' you have the steer with the arrow keys and some of the other actions are done with keys like 'Z' which also cannot be changed. This can result in the player having a hard time getting used to these controls.
Pros:
-Good looking graphics
-Good arcade-like physics
-Smooth but sturdy controls
-No noticable bugs (my experience)
-Unlock new items for your biker when completing levels
Cons:
-High price when taking in account replayability and early access
-Not a huge amount of capabilities in terms of content
-Singleplayer (not a con if you don't mind singleplayer games)
In conclusion I think that unless you are sure that you will enjoy this game, you should probably follow this games development and judge for yourself whether you want to play it. I like the game but I think they should try to encorporate multiplayer and add some more content as for the current price there are many other games that could be worth your money.
Overall rating - 5.5/10

Just the right balance of realistic and arcade-y. A high risk-high reward playstyle can make you win big, or blow up in your face. The graphics are friggin' beautiful. The physics are well-tuned, especially with how hard it is to roll your own in this kind of setup. The community is the nicest I've been in for a game. The developers are nifty and responsive to any community suggestions. The procedural level generation makes every run fresh and lends replay value.
12/10 a heckin fun game
