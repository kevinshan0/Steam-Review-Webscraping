Let me preface this game with this.
If you are a sim racer, walk away.
If you drift on Asetto Corsa, walk away.
If you take PC driving seriously, walk away.
If you drift in real life and are expecting it to be anything similar, walk away.
This game is not a realistic driver, at all. Cars handle nothing like you would expect them to. But what this game does do well, is fun. It's an amazing arcade drifter. And to be honest, I have more fun playing this than I do play Asetto, because I quite frankly can do what I want and not care, it's a fantastic game to unwind to. Wanna send a car into a wall at 300 km/h and drive away? Go for it. Wanna drift at stupid angles and still drive out of it? Be my guest. This game is an ARCADE DRIFTER, if you are looking for a sim, you have come to the wrong place. This game is absolutely incredible as an arcade drifter. I can't recommend more, me and all my friends have an absolute blast.

gud game no one will read this just want people to know it's fun
Posted: October 17, 2020
A really fun game to play. Even if you dont have friends to drift with, just drive a little, play the game and you'll find yourself tandem drifting with 5 other people.
+ Very good community
+ Really good graphics.
+ Not an Arcade Game like Forza Horizon and not a Simulation Game like Assetto Corsa. It is hard enough and fun enough.
Edit: Thank you guys for the community awards. I really appreciate that.
Posted: September 10, 2022
Cool game.
Chat is full of people spamming the N word and swastikas. Gives you old internet vibes.
Pretty fun game to drift in. I recommend.

late nights put some chill music and just drift and all your bad thoughts go away

What you will get playing this game ?
Good sides :
- 80% Arcade game
- Very new users friendly , very easy to plug and play
- Doesn't require a high understanding on how really a car works to make it drift
- Loads of cars , body kits , customisation
- Multiple mods that makes the game very spicy and interesting (Engine swaps , custom maps , competitions)
Bad sides :
- Poor wheel support
- NO ADMINS IN THE CHAT , full of acts of racism , sexism , insults , no moderation at all , bulling the new players
- Kinda toxic community in lobbies as well
- Poor livery customisation in detail
Overall thoughts :
After 3000 hours (2k hours on 2nd account) ill consider this game a really fun game to play with friends
Worth the money ? For sure !!
Great experience beside the community and the poor attention to moderation !

𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐑𝐎𝐃𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍
Hello All!
Here i will be listing the 𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐒 and 𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐒 of "CarX Drift Racing Online"
This is my personal opinion, so please read other reviews aswell as mine, before you buy the game.
𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐒
◆ Has Single-Player (Best Way To Grind - XP/Money)
◆ Has Multi-Player (You can create rooms for others to join (Up-to 16 Players)
◆ Steam Achievements (If you're into that stuff)
◆ Steam Trading Cards
◆ Controller Support (I use a Wheel)
◆ 5 Tiers Of Cars (Higher Tier = More Money)
◆ Wide Range of Cars and Customisation (Depending of the Car - Not all can be "visually" modified)
◆ You can "Challenge" other players
◆ It's not all about drifting (You can make a "Drift" Car or "Race" Car)
◆ Quite a few tracks to mess around with
◆ Smooth Gameplay
◆ Fast Loading Times
◆ There is 30 Player Levels (Level 12 unlocks all cars "Tier 5")
𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐒
◆ No Damage is recived to your Car after smashing into others/walls
◆ CarX can be grindy at times, but i always find myself practicing whilst grinding for Money
◆ Sometimes players just cannot Drift, and always hit you by accident (Just a Warning)
◆ Everything is cheap at the start, but higher "Tier" Cars become more expensive to upgrade
◆ Tier 5 Cars cost alot of money once you reach Level 12, try to prepare yourself for it.
◆ You can "Tune" Cars so they feel near enough the same
𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐂𝐋𝐔𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍
Overall this has to be my favorite game for Drifting, i've tried "Drift Streets Japan" But it was terrible compared to this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
𝐖𝐀𝐈𝐓, 𝐈 𝐍𝐎𝐓𝐈𝐂𝐄𝐃 𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐄 𝐈𝐒 𝐀𝐋𝐒𝐎 𝐃𝐋𝐂
Correct, there is DLC;
The Royal Trio
This DLC includes three new "skins" for a price of £2.99
Black Jack X22 - Drift Stars
EVA MR - Drift Champion
Cobra GT530 - CarX Racer
Personally, it's not worth it, unless you want a wrap for your Car.
CarX Drift Racing Online - Gold
This DLC is a "Starter Pack" you unlock items much faster and even receive "Special" vehicles, for a price of £3.99
Unique special edition of Atlas GT available only in the Gold Edition
Unique special edition for Caravan G6 - Ghost Drifter
Unique special edition for Thor 8800 - Santa Truck
Increased rates for experience x2
Increased rates for money x2
5,000,000 money as Start Bonus
So there you have it, my Pros and Cons + DLC Review!

I am a 41 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 16 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, got my car and map and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

A really fun game to play. Even if you dont have friends to drift with, just drive a little, play the game and you'll find yourself tandem drifting with 5 other people.
+ Very good community
+ Really good graphics.
+ Not an Arcade Game like Forza Horizon and not a Simulation Game like Assetto Corsa. It is hard enough and fun enough.

The game is fine, play the base game without the DLC's and see if you like it based on your preference. Great for chilling and relaxing. The game has some small bugs and glitches but they don't effect the main gameplay. Big customization for the cars and lots of tuning options to make them by your taste. The community is friendly and helpfull. Lots of mods to make the game more interesting and good looking.
Enjoy!

I can definitely say that this is a game you can enjoy even without being into cars, all that much. There's alot of freedom to the customization and the devs are constantly pumping out new content at a rapid pace. There is an active social scene, there's mods for the game and you can always drop into various different communities and end up feeling right at home.
That and I can drop a fat V8 in a Miata.

Very fun drifting game. Can hang out online with others, modify cars, do tandems etc. Works quite well with a wheel setup, infact I didnt have to change any settings. Online is also cross platform. You can do offline campaign challenges, challenge others online, get money, unlock tracks, level up and buy higher tier cars. So plenty things to progress to. Only thing i would say is the online global chat doesnt seem to be moderated and is always full of underage kids being racist.

This game is great, casual but super fun and relaxing, just drift away! I love it.
Small cons:
Lack of enginge sound diversity
No car damage
No wall tap points
Cars feel a bit too similar to each other
Posted: June 25, 2022
After playing it for 2 hours, I decided to write a review for the beginners. Before I bought it I was pretty negative about the fact you had to level up and earn money to buy cars and maps. Within the first 15 minutes, I actually wanted to refund it because the drifting was garbage. After that my dumb ass found out you can put a drifing tune on your car for 8k. So would I recommend this game? YES! After 2 hours you reach level 11 which means you can buy all cars. Making money is also the easiest thing in the world. Personally I play on a wheel and the only thing that is hard is doing tandems. If you play on kbm or controller drifting in this game is easier than learning how to walk. Compared to AC the drifting is a little bit more arcady but that is fine for me. If you' re hesitating to pick this game up, I would say try it and if you don't like it you can always refund it.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
9.5/10 - would drift again.
Would be a 10/10 but there's a severe lack of Eurobeat.
Posted: February 23, 2022
An absolute Driftgasm!
Drifting is always so satisfying no matter what game it is
A lot of customisation
Quite a few maps to play but really needs bigger and more maps
Simply drift n chill

Nothing beats getting in the zone with random people online just drifting to good music!!
Wanna be upset that your friend beat your score? Get this game!
Wanna Ruin your friends score? Get this game!
Wanna feel like an amazing Drifter.... but your really not? Get this game!
Honestly a lot of fun to be had with a good price tag!
Would love to see this game get a lot more upates now its popular, Give us some real control over what we want on our cars! and bring some new amazing maps!

In the first few hours you will learn the basics of a good drift. You realize that you can not quickly get into a turn and drift with a crazy speed. Because this is not Need for Speed but it's better than that. After each drift, you will be more proud of yourself because it seems more realistic.
You may need to change your car settings a bit to do a great drift. Although this section is relatively complex, it is worth a try.
The game is beautiful. The number and variety of cars is quite acceptable.
Although I suggest playing this game, there are a few problems:
1- I really want to see a leaderboard for each map. I want to know if I am better than my friends. I want to compete with them for the score of each map and compare my level with them.
2- This game does not provide a simple space for installing maps and car skins through the community. Although there are modes, some of them have bugs and they are not easy to install. Provide something like Left 4 Dead 2 for the community. This game can be legendary if you let the community add infinite maps, skins and cars.
But it seems that the creators have been a little greedy in this area for selling DLCs. This is a big mistake. Three maps and three DLC. I do not want it. I want infinite maps and I want to continue this game forever. So please change the revenue system via DLC and let the real potential of the game be shown.

I finally found a drift game I can relax in and enjoy myself, okish physics, solid graphics and tracks and of course now cross platform (PC, Xbox, PS4). I can put on my drift playlist and leave a trail of smoke around the track with friends and not have to fight the car and sit back slide. I played this game for a while on mobile and when I heard it was coming to PC I had to get it and was skeptical at first but the devs did patches for physics and controllability, graphics and sounds. I recommend this game for all newcomers for drifting and even veteran drifters if you want to relax and catch some doors. This game has great customization and designing ability for the paint booth and even better mods from the workshop to apply and make the game even better.
Posted: December 21, 2020
Absolutely love this game. Whilst I enjoy drifting in other games, I got bored from the lack of maps / good physics / customization / etc, so I decided to buy a new drift game. CarX is pretty fun so far, you have a lot of options for customization, the massive tandems with your friends and people you don't even know are awesome, there's so much more I can say but I'll keep it generally short. I just hope they add more future DLCs soon along with new cars.

Great for getting into the drift simulation games but once you master this, you are not ready for the real sim drifting games. THEN when you come back to Car X you find it insanely hard to play because its just so ridiculously unrealistic
