WOW what a game. I'm a NFL guy who knew nothing about soccer. This game has opened my eyes to an amazing sport.
The rollercoaster ride of live game management and the insane amount of depth you can get into managing your club is pure gold. I was looking for something like this for NFL but there's nothing that comes close.
I just took my hometown Portland Timbers to win it all. What a rush......15PKs to take down Philly at the MLS Cup....
I'm hooked.

TLDR: Solid 8/10. FM24: a refined version of FM23. Small but significant step in the right direction.
This year’s iteration is the final of the series before the upcoming major overhaul next year. Whilst changes are deemed “small”, they have had significant positive impact on the general feel of the game. The new set-piece routines are also a great plus for anyone that loves getting hands on with tactical set ups (one I am enjoying!).
Match Engine: A large improvement, fluid and succinct. Don't confuse yourself, this is and will never be FIFA.
By far a long, long overdue upgrade to the match engine, but the look, feel and visuals around it are a huge step up. Well done. Definitely not perfect nor AAA grade quality, but a big step up from previous years. If you are looking for FIFA level graphics, turn your attention elsewhere, this is a purely management simulator (and still far cleaner than any competitor products in its category).
• Players underlap/overlap appropriately (no more FB running into Wingers)
• Players understand spacing and no longer bunch up in the past
• Ball movement are more realistic (touches, bouces and dribbling)
• The defender shot blocking issues are resolved (less wild blocking, more penetration)
• Movement looks more natural.
• Flow of movement is very fluid
• Feels more realistic.
A very long due (more than) incremental match engine upgrade. Not graphics, but actual AI decisions, variable movements and more.
*Keep in mind, FM25 (or whatever it will be called) will bring in Unity, so expect any groundbreaking overhauls to occur next year. (But its SI, so don't fall prey to overexpectations)
Although some minor tweaks are required:
• You can still find out if VAR ruling before its announced by player celebrations (a premature anti-climax)
• Keeper movement looks a little lacklustre/delayed at times, but this is experienced in other football games as well, so I guess it’s a common difficulty.
It’s a finally good update to the series. and it only took up to its final iteration. Match engine and tactics to me are a great upgrade, no UI changes. But things feel smoother and more refined.
Despite some people stating large issues, I’ve personally not experienced anything on a new FM24 save.
• I've not had any injury issues
• I've not had "50 shots 0 goals" issues
• Game has run completely smooth for me.
For those saying the ME is terrible and they can’t seem to score. Instead of blaming the match engine when majority of others are satisfied with it, maybe look into your own tactical structures, training methods, and team cohesion. The silent majority seem to be fine, and I’ve not had any severe ME issues since FM21. The odd bogey team (Bournemouth and damn Solanke for me) does occur, but nonetheless, everything has been a significant step up this year in the ME.
Been playing since fm12, and fm24 is the best one since pre-2020.
I'm a sucker for FM and have always loved the game and continue buying it. It’s an amazing time killer. Particularly when you don't need to be glued to your screen to play it.
Could I have just downloaded a database update from the workshop for FM23? Yes. I could have also done that for FM19,20,21,22. But I love the game and franchise, no matter how much people claims it stagnated. It has killed thousands of hours for me (this doesn't even include the versions before Steam! or the Offline hours I had on previous iterations).
Is it worth the money? It’s definitely a yes for me. 8/10.

Tactical masterclass against the big teams just to lose to a team from Lichtenstein in the champions league, good game
Posted: January 16
My main issue with this game is how little it changes over editions, and how the devs just do not fix issues that have been there for multiple years. It's a bit of a joke at this point.
Pros:
- The match engine is much better this year. It actually looks and plays like real football.
Cons:
- Interactions/promises are completely broken to the point where most people just avoid them completely if poissible. I had a CB recalled to his club because he "wasn't playing as a central defender" despite him definitely playing there (and in the agreed role) the entire season.
- Everything is still based way too much on reputation. It doesn't change dynamically enough either. There should be an overall reputation and a 'current' rep because if I'm taking a team from rock bottom of League One to automatic promotion in one season I should be talk of the town but I barely get a rep boost. It's also just way too slow if you want to grow a team organically.
- AI Squadbuilding is still absolutely terrible and SI have said they're happy with how it currently is, which must be a lie. Clubs still focus way too much on rep and sign ageing players or players they do not need, instead of competing for prospects. It's way too easy to hoover up all the best talents for myself because the AI are stupid.
- Logic of the game is broken all over. Clubs rejecting offers for players and then selling them for way lower than those offers, players asking for super high wages at one club and accepting 3 times less than that at another similarly rated club, etc..
- Spread of talent over the world is not balanced. Lack of full-back newgens still an issue. Dynamic youth rating still not working very well.
- Newgen faces look atrocious and have only gotten worse. I know Miles said this is because he wants them to look like the player in game but you can barely even see the player faces in game! It's rubbish and ruins the immersion when half of your youth intake are balding 16 year-olds with vitiligo.

I'd like to see some improvement in stadiums and controlling club marketing, the more i do better in sales and investment, better players i can buy. if i can adjust my stadium like increase a certain stand and to pick up how it looks. another thing, if i can open academies in other countries to get best talents would be awesome as well. thank you if you consider any of those
Posted: November 6, 2023
If you buy the game every year, then yes its an improvement and buy it.
If you buy the game every two years, then don't buy as it's not a lot different.
If you've not bought the game for years or ever and are thinking about getting it, then buy it as its a good as any.
You can read all the reviews you want but those lines above are as much as they are all going to mean no matter how many words they have in them.

I'm enjoying this edition under a lot of aspects and I'd be okay with the problems and bugs I'll talk about if a piece of the game wasn't missing entirely: the in-game editor. It would allow players to solve issues that make no sense (e.g. a player being unhappy with a promise when it was actually fulfilled). Too bad the editor costs almost 10€. Either make the game PERFECT or don't charge me to be able to fix mistakes that you've made, which in the grand scheme of things could also be acceptable.
That being said, with dynamics being an increasingly relevant aspect to team management in the game, you'd think that part of FM would also make some sense. Unfortunately, that's not quite the case and most FM players will have to exploit some mechanics to get by. Just look online and you'll see everybody avoiding promises like the plague due to very limited options in dealing with players. I'm okay with certain aspects being crude and most resources working towards FM25, I accept that. The fact is that people management is so important, you can't afford to put in irreversible game breaking bugs.

I'm enjoying the game a lot. I'm playing a sixth level german league save since FM 2023 (thanks to the ability to import savegames from FM 23) for about 700 hours now. Degree of realism is incredible, especially when it comes to signing players (they all divas, lol).
German translation of the game is flawless and not just only translated from english but using german football phrases, which impressed me a lot as well.
Worth any cent and beyond. Thanks for the great work and contributing to my happiness in my free time.
story time for interested :
I'm on the way to the 4th level after about 7 seasons (hoping to be promoted next one). The competition financial wise is incredible since I'm managing a poor club from sixth level, I'm stuggling to sign good players and many of them leave after one or two good seasons for better and more renown clubs. But thats not always the rule. Sometimes, you manage to sign a player which is basically too good for your club and he might even stay loyal, which makes the scouting and signing players very enjoyable.
My goal is obviously Bundesliga with this exact sixth level club (I played there when I was young). Let's see how far it takes me till I get sacked, lol.
Posted: November 12, 2023
I have never posted an online review for the previous versions of FM that I have bought. But I am posting for this one. Because I am so annoyed with the broken player interaction in this game. One player goes down a league to join 'a bigger club'. Other players with a 2 and a half star rating start demanding high wages as soon as you get promoted that dont merit their ability. Then the whole squad is unhappy with your treatment of that player because they too want a high contract. And this is all when they know that the club is 40 million in debt.

Started off at Hampton & Richmond, spent the year there getting promoted.
Moved onto Colchester in league one where I got them promoted to Championship before getting offered a job at Norwich.
Joined Norwich, most my players demanded to leave due to relegation (before I joined) so I sell them. I make a ton of money and then the board takes nearly all of it away. I get promoted to the Prem.
I sign a ton of players for the prem and I finish in 15th, not confident in surviving a second year I spend big.
I bring in some proven players and then I go all out in Signing Van Persie's kid... he fails to score reguarly... I have no good striker yet...
I have constant anxiety over finding a goal scorer... but hey I have a great japanese winger wonderkid... help?
Overall great game which gives you highs and lows like no other game.

Marketed as the "most polished version yet". Headline features were that AI would be better, in reality AI is actually worse than ever and SI's response is that the fix is "coming soon". Headline feature "coming soon" is an absolute shambles. Feels like they have conned people into buying their game yet again whilst it takes another step backwards. Interactions were also marketed as a headline feature, they are also worse than ever. You have 5 CB's, the whole squad throws a tantrum because you don't have enough depth at CB, sign 2 more, they are still unhappy.
Don't bother buying, wait until FM25 with the new engine, though I have no doubt that will only bring worse bugs and releases.
Oh and SI, don't bother having a beta / early access / whatever you pretend it is if you then ignore every single bug flagged up in this period and carry on with releasing a load of absolute poo. Conmen.

It's not really any different from any other fm game in the last few years. I've enjoyed my time with it and will continue to play but it always feels like there's something missing. Series hasn't felt the same since fm20 for me it's like a little bit of the soul got left behind those years ago. Probably something to do with the UI since that's most of the game and i don't really like it that much. Still, at the end of the day it's a fm game and if you enjoy the regular formula you'll enjoy this one again. Match engine is something i don't really care that much about but it's nice to see the improvements to how the football flows and feels. Regens have somehow managed to get even uglier it's like they're regressing every year. idk if the 45 quid price tag really speaks to me considering i'd rather go back and play fm 20 again but its a great game if you can get it on sale or something

So we have had an update . I would have to write about 10 pages to tell you about this franchise that consistently treats its buyer and players like sheep . So i will say this , why have a bugs forum on the Football Manager forum where you can see bugs in the game whether its the ME or Data related etc if you are not going to make an effort to fix them . Unfortunately the franchise has steady gone down the track of cheap sales and reviews for the sake of detailed database and ME ( Match Engine) . There sole purpose now is to get the game to appeal to younger people for those on Xbox or PS5s .Since FM17 it has become noticeable that they have taken a different direction to capture a different audience . While you see that there are Very Positive reviews this is the reason for any reasonable update . They think well we don't need to converse with our fan base as everything is fine . As the new people keep buying the next instalments you will see the lies that start appearing and the silence and the lack of support from the company . So many bugs that are in this game and have been in the game from 10 years ago still are being ignored . The ME needed a few fixes that have been there for at least 5 years yet we as supporters get nothing to fix them . There whole excuse is now this . Thanks for buying FM24 but we are too busy to support it anymore as we are moving on to FM25 . They have even stated they are now solely into FM25 as they have now going to Unity graphics . So regardless of the bugs in FM24 there response is , we don't care . Unfortunately you just cant trust these people anymore . Its Money Money Money .The head of the company has been there too long . New blood is needed to push this franchise in a better direction because its just becoming an arcade game . I have bought every game since 2008 so i know how its grown and been destroyed at the same time . Sure give it a Positive Review because as a new purchaser of the game i would do that too but as a long time purchaser i cant recommend it . FM25 is well going to be so bug ridden it would be a miracle if it even gets off the ground as a playable game . As with a lot of games in todays world it isnt the game itself thats the problem ITS THE DEVELOPERS .

A classic FM as we know it, however I am giving it thumbs down this time as it is really blatantly done in manner of "I don't give a ........, they will buy it anyway because they want the players to be updated to 23/24 season stats".
I know that next year we are promised big changes from graphics to whatnot, however this FM is really just a database info update and free kicks management as a bonus to that. You can now set targets to players and I have to admit that this seems great, however I have not yet finished enough of them to check how impactful they are.
Oh yeah, one more thing, you can now sell all players you don't want to have when rebuilding a team to Saudi, or at least everyone elses team in the game seems to be, only in mine they are interested, however not buying.
Otherwise no change, still 4-2-3-1 gegenpress all day, play ball into box still means they will hoof it from the sidelines by air, you can just keep the "encourage" and "berate" shout and get rid of all the rest as players just start crying. There are apparently 2000 new interactions added, however all press conferences have the exactly same replies at the exactly same spot as last year. I just read first 5 words of the press question and know what box to click at bcs I played FM23 and they did not even bother to shuffle the reply fields. Also if the press asks me about how great of a start to the career at my club my new signing has and I say "he became one of the key players immediately" maybe the player could at least react well to this? Or he does not care I gave him such a praise? I mean AI is creating people's thesis now and here I get asked if I am not afraid of overconfidence when I won first two matches of the season and am about to play the third one.
No, I do not believe I am particularly well versed in mind-games, I just said that playing Olympiacos in EL when managing Ajax is going to be a tough game and we managed to win.
No, I am not interested in buying 32 year old defender for 5M when I just bought two other CBs and have 1M transfer budget left, can they at least ask me on the press conferences about players I scout and not pick totally random players for triple the price of my transfer budget I had at the start of the transfer window?
I am really disappointed that any more changes are just "coming next year for sure" right? *insert Natalie Portman from Star Wars* RIGHT?

I last played this in 2017. I kept playing this one in the hopes I would find anything that would set it apart from 2017. In -7- years it is almost exactly the same game, even down to the flavour text questions. (And some STILL have spelling mistakes,... 7 YEARS later.) If anything, it has gotton worse. You can't assemble a world class team without them moaning about not all being played day in day out, despite real world elite footballers understanding the words "squad rotation." There is then NO way to appease them - loads of BUTTONS, loads of OPTIONS, but save scumming and trying them all proves NONE of them work apart from appeasement. And if the squad then get angry at you, again, NO BUTTON WORKS EXCEPT APPEASMENT. What is the POINT of putting all those options in if NONE of them work?? And the player they were angry about? His average for the season was 6.7 and his current average was 6.4.... And these players thought he DESERVED HIS PLACE IN THE TEAM BASED ON FORM.
Real world elite football squads do not work like this. They do not gang up on the manager in droves to defend a player who is playing awful and then throw a collective hissy fit where they tank their perfomances on purpose.
So that, combined with the fact that even awful FIFA improved its game year-on-year more than this lazy developer, means I will not be trying this product again for probably another 10 years.
7 years and the exact same game with no major upgrades... it beggars belief.
Posted: November 7, 2023
Let's see ... where to begin ...
Licensing issues. A mess. The much hyped Japanese "fully licensed" leagues are - guess what? Not fully licensed and so players who want to experience them are out of luck until SI gets its act together.
AI squad building. A mess. AI still signs multi-million pound players for obscene fees and with no logic whatsoever to the deals ... and then doesn't play them.
MOST TEAMS DO NOT MAKE SUBSTITUTIONS ... yes, you've read that correctly. Almost all substitutions in the game come as a result of injuries or fatigue and happen from 85 minutes onward. Spot the tactical substitution and win a star prize. And this is WORSE in the academy section of the game where entire weeks go by without the AI subbing ANY players at all which destroys the late game.
The Champions League new format, which worked fine in 2023 version, draws clubs from the same countries against each other ... what a joke. No-one in-house at SI spotted that before release?
I could go on and on. The game has been out for a fortnight in Early Access. You HOPE that some of these issues will be resolved on Day One ... instead, nothing. And some vague promises about a patch somewhere along the line, which probably means weeks.
There is NO WAY I can justify recommending this title. And I have often added a caveat to that sort of statement "at the moment." But this is a joke. So I'm not changing this review later on. The release version is unacceptable. It's dire. And a lot of people feel conned by the Japanese licensing thing.
No company except for Creative Assembly is in more dire need of a rival to snap them out of their complacency and arrogance. The irony is that the match engine, in its final iteration, is the best it's ever been and would be a gold star point all on its own other than the rest of this.
Posted: November 9, 2023
I've been playing since 1999 when it was championship manager and I believe it was the year Figo joined real Madrid. So far I'm loving it again this year. A little apprehensive about next year I hope they don't diverge to far away from a winning formula. 10/10
Posted: November 21, 2023
Yes, I liked it because it is a classic. But more improvements could have been made in all this time. The match engine looks more organic, but there is no big difference. We have a better feel for different pitches, different lightings and weather conditions, but now FM needs a much bigger leap.
Posted: December 1, 2023
end of an era for football manager, honestly the best installment of fm i've played in years soley based on how fast the game loads between continues. Won't be surprised if the new fm is bad and we will still be playing this next year
Posted: November 24, 2023
''most refined fm 24 we've released'
-improved AI squad managements/transfers = no substitutes, wonderkids rotting in reserves at 24 years old, buying players for 50+ mil to play 2 games in a year
-J league kits/players not complete at release and even still isn't (zero communication external, internal cheeky adjusted the text of j leaugue from the website)
-most attributes dont matter, speed and physical all the way ,every, year.
-ME is improved a bit, lets wait till they ♥♥♥♥ it up again in the next patch
-ONLY gegenpress(see fm arena) is overpowered AGAIN
-tactics creator is just outdated and just flat out bad, user has no control or little, feels scripted (due to attributes hardly matter) and the instructions are so rigid, feels old, inflexible. adding new roles like ifb and changing HB, FB dont matter, they are all hard scripted roles, which means that you can put any player in the position and they play the same, if there attributes are not too far apart.
-Too many goals 2024 is hockey simulator
-bugs like set piece coach wage cant be raised, not able to hire a set piece coach for the reserve and youth team (but you can train it with normal coaches?)
- great improvement of player interactions and media handling, so much fun!!!! /s
-goalkeepers hands that break from touching the ball
- and other countless bugs(from previous editions) im tired to mention (see fm community forum)
but no this is the most polished version ever, maybe in recent years it is the best, but it worries me that they market this as the best, when released in this state. worries me for future games of SI, jk you lost me this year as a customer
year after year under delivering, and then seeing the ceo Miles, being proud of this ♥♥♥♥♥ on twitter, means this game is doomed. looking forward to in game character customisation , the face paint, unseeable watch and scarf has been top additions! maybe monetize it like fifa as well?

Nothing has really changed, its still basically paying 40£ for a database update. Been playing since cm on amiga, and the first fm when they all legged it.
the frustrating parts for me are the obvious lack of intelligence when playing the computer
1. Transfer deals are insanely favourable of the computer clubs, if you try and sell a player at their value, 96% of the the time, you lose. It doesnt really understand form/morale/consistency/loyalty
2. The amount of dumb involved if you play in lower leagues is STILL total ♥♥♥♥, for example, a club promoted to the premier league CANNOT attract better players even if they are promoted with lots of time left in the season, you have to wait until the new season actually begins and your clubs rep is increased. This completely hinders squad building, is completely unrealistic, and changes the game massively.
3. Squad dynamics is hosed, normal people do not, just lose their ♥♥♥♥ from being removed as vice captain, or not instantly getting a new contract, or not playing for a couple of months at aged 17 because you signed them from some brazilian team for 250k, or because you told them all they played like a bunch of 10 year olds in the sunday blind league and lost 7-0 to barnsley at home, and then the result is half your squad descending into complete depression and hatred for your management style despite you being 3rd in the league and clearly in contention for the title.
4.What the hell is the point of repeated, duplicated questions in press conferences which are CLEARLY designed to influence morale and in terms performance, there is such massively OBVIOUS weighting in your responses to these its painfully, boring af and makes me want to scratch my eyes out with a rusty spork. SORT IT OUT SI. The press dont repeat the same nonsense in real life and the answers are far too limited, theres a complete lack of AI and general intelligence here, it WAS cool for a few years, but ive been answering the same question and "smiling warmly" for far far too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long just to maintain my squads unbeaten 7 game run.
5. Coaching "your players are unhappy with training" - except, it doesnt actually matter wtf you actually do here, they are always unhappy, regardless of how well your team has done being promoted 3 times on the bounce and establishing yourself in the premier league within 5 seasons.
6. How have you STILL not developed a tactical editor which lets you MANUALLY position your players with complete freedom! Have you ever actually tried to position 3 centre back together in a 352 manually during a game !?!?!?!?! lmao
7. Chairman/board negotiations are STILL DUMB!!!! oh you have 13 coaches and have won the league and the champions league 6 times in a row, have built up 500 mill in the bank, sry m8, nah you cant have another coach on 4.5k a week , gonna ruin us.
8. Mangers need more control!!!!!! real managers, manage football clubs from top to bottom, if i want to sack margie the tea lady and old bill the 1 legged kit man so i can free up 500£ a week to give my star striker in the caravan south east div reserves then I SHOULD BE ABLE TO!!!!! thats some basic "heres a slider, redistribute the wealth as you see fit" functionality.
9. MORE THINGS IVE FORGOTTEN
10. I will continue to play, i love it, but where are these basic things, more camera angles, chairman and owner mode,more customising, youve got ALL the footballer details spot on but its like playing the same game over and over every year without updating the tiny realistic business details

Except the defensive third rotations which are a nice touch, there isn't a thing in this game that is working correctly.
Ridiculous own goals and mistakes from defense and GK
Attributes mean nothing in away games, your players play like sunday league in 8 away games out of 10
Opp GK regularly get 7+ rating against you for no reason, then returns to be subpar against other AI teams
ST roles are purely there for decoration. F9, TQ, AF, P, DLF, they all behave the same, they stay central, sit in the box, run in behind more or less depending on the duty, and they don't roam no matter which instruction/PPM you give them
Winger roles are designed to make you lose the ball, they get pressed down too easily and forget how to dribble or pass 8 times out of 10
This game should be renamed table foosball manager, the whole AM strata behave like they're linked by a metal bar and they all move and attack at the same time, same for the ST roles
The through balls in this edition are so badly executed it hurts
The average decisions, even with high attribute, specially in away games, are mostly rubbish
The instructions "roam from position" and "move into channels" do not work
The players stay static in their zones and make this edition boring to watch
Most AI manager play with either IWB/IFB or both even when they don't have the staff for
The final third imposes a hidden timer on your players (based on tempo), once the timer is over the player with the ball shoots no matter what (again rubbish decisions).
Once you get to the final third, there is no role in the AM and ST strata that is intelligent enough to pull back or wide from the box to recycle possession or draw defenders. They all behave like bulls and sit in the box.

Intermediaries are my favourite update from any fm, it just makes it a lot easier to get rid of dead weight or sell high-value players who have no market interest.

Another year, another FM.
Sadly, just like last year, Sports Interactive marketed well only to under deliver on their much promised 'most polished version ever'. Currently the game is a mess. AI squad building (key feature this year) is terrible; players are still being bought and not played, youth teams become empty, squad rotation doesn't happen.
Player Interactions (another key feature) are just as wild.
Match Engine (another key feature) is wonderful in attack, yet defensively is a nightmare.
And the Japanese A-League (super feature) license is... half-baked.
Sadly, Sports Interactive and SEGA are the defacto football manager game at the moment, so they can get away with these terrible releases. Its a shame really, as the ME (defending aside) looks great this year and the processing speed is lightning fast, even with a huge database.
I just wish someone would muzzle and reign in Miles Jacobson from over promising every damn year, and let the team fix legacy bugs before adding new half-finished/forgotten features that cause new issues.
As it currently stands I do not recommend this game, hopefully one of the two allotted patch windows Pre/Post-Winter Update will fix the majority of them. Hopefully.

Too few changes to justify a new game every year. Feels like I'm playing 2022 version which already felt like I was playing 2015 version.
EDIT: So I played in Serie A. Took control of Genua, rebuilt them and 2 years later I'm in the title race. I end up finishing level on points with Milan. They had better goal difference, I had better head to head (I beat them home and away). I got the "title winning" animation at the end of the final match... And then the game told me that I need to have 2 more play off games at the end of the season. Cool.
I win the first game at home 3-1. Second game happens 3 days later... And half my squad went on international duty... Why is there no option to have players stay at club (or at least ask them to do it) and fight for the title that the club didn't win for like 100 years? It wasn't even World Cup or Euros year, so why would they prioritize some random ass friendly matches over what's basically a final? Anyway, 3-0 loss at Milan, title lost, back on the grind.

compared to fm2022 this is basically just a roster update for 60 Euro which is ridiculous
95% of the game, ui and dialogs is unchanged!

Besides some really odd graphical issues. This version of FM is pretty solid. I've been kind of taking my time to get through the seasons and this works for me. I'm going to try an win Bundesliga before the new one comes out and then I'll start a campaign in the Americas to wrap it up. I might even do a full USA league ascension (From USL1 division to the MLS). I'll have to download them, but the Steam Workshop and tutorials on YT make things very simple. I know next years with do away with all of this, but SI have done a decent job with this one.

There is something incredible strange in this game. More than ever i feel the game no matter what the tactic already chose what the results gonna be. First of all i dont know what is the matter with away games. But i completed 2 seasons with united and it always went something like every 20 home games i won 18 on them. Every 20 games away i win 5 or 6. No matter how much i tried to improve my tactics mentality etc... Another very strange thing happened when i was playing a 2 division portuguese team that their goal was just not to go to 3 division and i just spent all season playing with a low block counter attack team with the most subhuman players you could ever imagine and ended up on a almost 20 win streak game and in the end being promoted to the 1 division or funny enough my first 10 games on this 1 division were just draw and losses playing the exact same football with a very similar team like wtf?
Maybe its just my experience but everything seems soooo... weird and most of the time not even fun i just think theres something strange going on about this fm but maybe its just me.

Not many of the "new" features actually work.
Still not able to start a functional Japan save despite it being a headline feature.
The match engine is much improved but other than that I've not noticed any massive difference to fm23.
I love FM, been playing for nearly 25 years since cm 00/01. I buy the game every year and will continue to do so, but it's important that a monopolistic company with demonstrably limited appetite for feedback takes note of how a significant portion of it's most dedicated player base feels.
Unfortunately Miles only seems to care about the steam reviews these days, so here we go!

If you never played any other Football Manager game then i recommend it.
If you did, then it's not worth getting it at full price, it's basically the same as the previous 4-5 editions with a few tactical things added or modified that don't really impact the gameplay that much.
There is still a huge problem regarding AI's decision making, intelligence and men management, especially when it comes to young prospects and old players. Most of the teams will use an old player until he retires or he becomes unusable instead of trying to develop prospects with really high potential - a good example would be Endrick in my PSV save, in 2026 he still hasn't debuted for Real Madrid, and is only a player for their THIRD team. Most of the time you can't buy players that are under the age of 18, because they don't want to move, even if your team is much better than their current one.
Another big problem you're going to meet if you're trying to build a better league is the way the rival teams will make transfers or add staff, most of the time they won't improve their coaches and they will make mediocre transfers that don't improve them.
The red flag when it comes to player values is that almost every other average player that is a bit decent is worth 50m+ even if he's only got 2 years of contract let's say. This way, they keep resigning with the same team and you barely see any realistic transfers like in real life or any free transfers.
The visual system is still outdated, even if they improved it a bit. It's almost the same as Football Manager 2013, looking like an online free football game from the late 2000s.

It's too similar to the past 10 games in the series. The series needs a complete revamp, better UI, new designers and developers. With all the money they drained from players over the years its still an excel spreadsheet. Very lazy and low effort.
Posted: November 7, 2023
Totally not worth the price. Barely anything changes from previous games. Last I bought was 2021. Game barely changed since then. Wait 2030 for a change, maybe. The company basically sells the same game every year at full price with a database refresh. Game mechnics are still flawed.
It's also a clicky simulator, press continue 50 times between each game, press conferences are all the same. Players are all drama queens, bringing just annoyance.
Players have 30+ attributes, and in the end only two or three of them matters. Buy players with high determination, he will shoot goals from 25m shot even if his shooting skill is 5/20. Dev of this game loves to add layers of game mechanics which are very time consuming for players but in the end of almost 0 impact on the outcome of your save. Wanna spend time on crafting special training? Well, does not change anything. Want to avoid players injury by resting them? Well they will get injured anyway during rest time and even during tactic session in the dressing room. Why? Because it's primarily random.
Sound design is catastrophic, same as a game from attari computers.
Hire good staff? Barely changes anything to players development. 95% of their development track is precalculated in hidden stats.
If you play a team playing in an amateur league, you will see the exact same match actions, tactics, pace, etc as if you manage a team like Man City. Games are all the same whether it's good teams or bad team vs each others.
I wouldn't be negative if they had been developing this game for 3 years. But it's in development for 15 years, every year sold at full price for such little improvement over time.
Game has turned into a cash grab. Very sad.
Posted: November 19, 2023
Yes, I can recommend the game but with some reservations. I am playing Football Manager since FM2008. This is the first time, I feel I didn't do justice to my money with my day-1 purchase.
First of all, this is a huge complex simulation game. Lots of players, staffs in the game and their interaction, hundreds of matches and it's calculation. There bound to be some bugs happen at release. Unfortunately, this year the bugs were more than doubled. None of them are game-breaking but definitely many of them are immersion breaking.
Some bugs regarding AI managers and clubs decisions, making this game very easy to break. You will not feel challenged enough. AI manager will not make subs, and you can change 5 subs and win the game during last 10-15 mins. AI transfer still very weak, they are buying players but not playing them or playing them in different positions, making the player under-perform. AI players also making stupid decisions during transfer by chosing lesser team with respect to money or competition etc.
Steam doesn't allow number rating, so I cannot say this is a 6 out 10 game. So, officially I selected "recommended" but with some reservations. If you liked older FM, then this game is immersion breaking. If you are a newcomer, this game is easy to exploit, but you won't be challenged enough by AI.
I hope SI fixes this in future. Till then I will go back to FM23.

Football Manager 2024? A Mixed Bag of Enhancements and Frustrations! (ฅ'ω'ฅ)
[1] Intro :
Football Manager 2024, the latest installment in the renowned sports simulation series, promises an immersive experience for football enthusiasts worldwide. Boasting enhancements in player animations, ball physics, and lighting, the Truer Football Motion aims to provide the most realistic Match Engine in the franchise's history. Additionally, new features like a revamped Set Piece Creator, refined transfer market dynamics, and the introduction of Intermediaries offer fresh challenges and strategic opportunities for aspiring virtual managers.
[2] Game Experience :
One of the standout features is the ability to import existing careers from Football Manager 2023, providing continuity for players deeply invested in their managerial journeys. The game also introduces individual Targets for players, adding a layer of personalization to team management. However, it's crucial to note that, at the time of this review, some information is still pending approval by rights holders, potentially affecting the accuracy of real-world data.
User reviews reflect a mix of opinions, with some players praising the incremental improvements in the Match Engine. The long-overdue upgrade addresses issues like player movements, spacing, and ball physics, creating a more realistic and fluid gaming experience. However, there are still minor concerns, such as premature anti-climaxes related to VAR rulings and occasional lackluster goalkeeper movements.
While some users report a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience with no major issues, others express dissatisfaction with the game's current state. Complaints range from licensing problems, particularly with the Japanese leagues, to AI squad-building issues where computer-controlled teams sign players without logical utilization. The Champions League format is also criticized for drawing clubs from the same countries against each other, diminishing the authenticity of the competition.
The introduction of new features like Set Piece Coaches, TransferRoom, and the Real World and Your World game modes receives mixed reactions. Some appreciate the depth these additions bring to squad management, while others argue that certain changes, such as player interactions and squad dynamics, feel unpolished and unpredictable.
A recurring concern is the presence of bugs and the game's reliance on Denuvo DRM, prompting frustration among users. The dissatisfaction is further exacerbated by licensing discrepancies, especially with the heavily promoted Japanese leagues not being fully licensed as advertised.
[3] Verdict :
In conclusion, Football Manager 2024 presents a refined version of its predecessor, offering incremental improvements in the Match Engine and various gameplay aspects. While some users find the updates commendable and enjoy a smooth gaming experience, others express disappointment with unresolved issues, AI shortcomings, and licensing discrepancies. As the series looks ahead to a major overhaul in the next iteration, Football Manager 2024 stands as a mixed bag, leaving room for improvement and a cautious recommendation for potential buyers.

Now the game has been updated, I can recommend it. The state it was in at release was unacceptable however. The match engine this year is a joy to behold.

TLDR: This is a Must buy for every FM player and this is the best that FM has been in what it feels like a forever of copy and paste.
if you haven't played before than this is THE BEST Time to try it.
I have been more than ecstatic with what i experienced and without a shred of doubt i will recommend it every day...
Well gather along gentlemen as it's that time of the year again. "Football Manager 24", Well The Arabs are here and they mean Business.
Starting off i'd like to just outright put it out there that FM24 is Actually by-far the most complete and if i may the "Definitive Edition" of FM. There are a lot of features in this title update and this has been so far my smoothest experience for FM till date. SI has huge plans for FM25 and i have never been less hyped for it than now after playing a good chunk of FM24.
FM 23 was an actual turd when it came to what new features it brought to the newer title but this year FM is as feature packed as it has ever been. There is everything that you need and plus there's even more that you might've never thought you needed but it's still here.
Starting off with the actual gameplay, IT'S SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SMOOTH, i have been just watching the football roll left and right and bounce everywhere and god am i edged already. It is an orgasm to our eyes how well the player motion and football motion is this year.
The lighting is brilliant as well and some of those evening matches look as good as they'll ever look.
Hiring intermediaries is one of the most needed features as well especially when you need to get rid of sergio roberto like deadwood with ceiling high wages.
The overhaul for set-piece training is also a very good touch, i haven't totally indulged into that but great to know it's there when i need to.
Setting Targets, guys hear me out. Please set targets!! i can't explain the feeling when a player asks for unjustly high playing time and then i set a target for him to complete if completed he gets the play time, if they actually play like that then looks like they actually deserve it and mostly when they don't neither do i have to promote them and nor do they reject the contract and shake the team dynamics.
The Real World career mirrors the first season transfers and limits the transfers for the rest of the window and it is such an amazing and true to life way to play and goes miles towards actually feeling like a real life manager of your favourite team!
Posted: November 6, 2023
The game is the most complete version of Football Manager. From the recent changes, I like the new ball physics and transfer offloading options through intermediaries and agents. The set pieces system seems nice but potentially may be abused with certain setups, so I need more tinkering with it. Saudi clubs are feeding clubs with money, but feel like reality. This is the most stable game I highly recommend, as the Unity game engine in FM25 bears a significant risk.
I hope the game developers will include more match statistics, so I can do even more cool analytics stuff with the MoneyballFM website (moneyballfm.com).
Posted: November 17, 2023
You know the game engine is terrible when you hit the post 5 times a game....i only buy fm every 2 years to check improvements and honestly its got no better over 10 years, your team dominates with 80% possession and gets rinsed 3-0 clearly scripted matches mean player ability counts for nothing, constant disallowed goals and again the worlds biggest posts
its a no from me
Posted: November 9, 2023
I always tell myself I won't buy the next edition of FM because of minimal changes and promised features that either never materialise or never live up to hopes. So of course I bought this on pre-order, and of course regret it.
As with past releases, the early days of FM24 are full of bugs that make the game lose its enjoyability - goalkeepers repeatedly getting injured for catching the ball, shot>goal conversion rates being way out of sync with reality, with regularly unrealistic sky high numbers of goals being scored across a season, player interactions being the equivalent of managing toddlers who don't follow the most basic common sense arguments... And all that doesn't even mention the features - A J-League billed as fully licensed being included in its bare bones, dynamic revenue streams linked to success being no different than any other edition and plenty of other things that don't live up to expectations.
I am sure given time SI will fix the bulk of these things, and at that point the game will be worth buying, but until then save your money unless there's a sale going on. One of these days I'll actually follow through and not order these in advance... but sadly it's too late for me this edition! it's not too late for you.

Some cool new animations in the match engine but little else to set it apart from FM23. The "big features" feel like poor reskins of features we've had previously, just the same info presented slightly differently.
Getting a little tired of the tiny incremental "upgrades" really hoping they pull it out the bag for FM25 and release something fresh cos this franchise whilst still being the pinnacle of the genre is in dire need of new ideas.

Same game as usual. You need to play how the game is designed and wants you to play to have any chance of success. You cant be your own manager and play with your own tactics.
Posted: March 28
This game is like crack. If you try it once, you'll be addicted
Posted: November 6, 2023
Keeps refining and building strengths upon strengths every year.
A further expansion of transfer options (especially offloading players through intermediaries which is a great addition) after last years scouting overhaul. More in-depth set-pieces option although they can still be very much abused.
Lots of small QoL improvements from UI to match engine fluidity to player interaction.
Save carry over from the previous version is welcomed yet kind of unnecessary.
Feels like the culmination of about a 10 or so year cycle of FM releases before entering a new, very intriguing, Unity based era.
