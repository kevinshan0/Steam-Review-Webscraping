This game requires an active online connection just to get past the main menu. You cannot play this game offline, who thought that was a good idea?

if buying a game doesn't mean you own it, then piracy is not theft.

I love steep. But I hate Ubisoft. I hate that Riders republic is essentially my steep 2, and we all know these servers will go down before they end up making these offline compatible, much like the crew.. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ games </3

Steep is a weird game. A love letter to exploring the picturesque Swiss Alps by way of extreme sports, it toes the line between realism and Red Bull guzzling, MTV goofiness. It's built for scale and spectacle, but digging deeper to actually play the game can feel like you're on a team of beta testers, sharing challenges you pulled out of your ass and turning a blind eye to the glaring glitches and rough edges. It suffers from an identity crisis; one minute you'll be paragliding peacefully above a glacier while your avatar narrates a somber diary of conquering the wilderness, fighting oxygen deprivation and dehydration. Then you'll be following a literal ghost rider through the mouths of Ubisoft's Raving Rabbids mascots or being lectured by a stereotypical New York agent for not hitting enough “sick” kickflips. Or a mountain will try to intimidate you, reciting some Robert Frost style poetry. Steep is best played with an open mind. A really open mind...
 
  The game can be stunningly gorgeous; the scale of the mountain range is very impressive and boasts some of the most realistic looking representation of snow I've seen. The glittering of the sun off of fresh powder in particular is approaching levels of photorealism. The detail of your character is quite sharp as well, especially considering the vast amount of unlockable accessories available to outfit him/her in. Traversing the frozen environment also leaves convincing tracks as you sink into the drifts, climbing steep slopes to reach points of interest. An applaudable amount of work and artistry went into the snow, but some of the elements surrounding it look out of place. Rocky surfaces can look like smears painted with a broad brush, often visibly, hastily thrown together at artificially rough angles and clipping through each other. Trees and glaciers are carbon copies of each other, leading to stretches of boring, repeating terrain. But the large scale picture is the reason for playing, and these are the compromises of a completely open, load-free playground.
 
  You have five modes of transport at your disposal: skiing, snowboarding, paragliding, wing gliding, and walking. Skiing and snowboarding are similar and the challenges that feature them are interchangeable. You have very simple controls with these two: steer with the left stick, the right stick cuts sharply, you hold and release jump to ollie, and from there you can spin and grab. For the most part, though, you're at the mercy of the mountain; it's incredibly difficult to make quick adjustments and it can be a struggle to get your avatar to do what you want to do without serious effort. You have no control over the camera, and that becomes an adversary; jamming to the right trying to hit a checkpoint can easily be undermined by a wild, uncontrollable swing or zoom because the game felt like it. You certainly don't have Tony Hawk/SSX levels of control, which is fine, but what's in Steep is better described as “loose” than simulation. After about twenty hours of playing I felt adjusted to the game's quirks, but more often than not trying to get your rider to generally perform something specific still comes down to trial and error, combating the controls, and a good amount of luck. You're provided with a G-meter that is supposed to track how much punishment you can take before you spill, but in practice the game just does what it wants; a ten second free fall onto solid rock might be okay, but hitting what appears to be a pebble may or may not send you into a knockout faceplant.
 
  Wing gliding is the highlight. Flying inches above the ground, weaving around snow covered trees and sharp rocks is exhilarating and it controls responsively. Most of the challenges in the wing suit revolve around passing through rings and gives a serious Pilotwings vibe. Paragliding is more relaxed and is the preferred method for exploring the Alps, allowing you to cover large swaths of land and soak in the sights while you're at it. You're given a very generous updraft system: get close and kinda/sorta perpendicular to a mountainside and there will always be uplift, essentially allowing you to glide endlessly. I'm pretty sure that's not how wind works, but whatever. Walking is where you put one foot in front of the other to initiate locomotion, and while on foot you can use binoculars to spot drop zones and places of interest.
 
  The scale and freeform exploration is great, but the “game” part of the game, the challenges, are all over the place. These events are scattered all over the mountains and they're generally races against the clock or score based affairs. They are categorized into Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties, and you can earn bronze, silver, or gold medals depending on your performance, which awards XP to level up to unlock drop zones and currency to buy cosmetic items. The open nature of the game itself wrecks havoc with any scoring conventions; a single, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trick pulled out of your ass can destroy a gold medal challenge in seconds. Alternatively, a glitchy camera can be a repeatable bane to finishing a race without ragdolling down a cliff face, and the difference between a gold medal or complete failure can either be a matter of minutes or seconds. There's very little consistency between which challenges will be a fun exercise in sharpening your skills or controller throwing frustration.
 
  And that's Steep broadly speaking. It demands to be enjoyed with a relaxed demeanor and forgiving nature from a zoomed out perspective. If you can find that zen state it's one of the best extreme sports games that's released in years. Just don't look at it too closely.

I was really itching to play a game that would satisfy my 1080 Avalanche craving. I decided to give this a shot when I found a good deal on it.
Was not dissapointed. Only thing I can complain about is that some of the song choices don't fit the game at all (I usually just go onto Soundcloud using the overlay browser to get some better music going).
I see myself playing this a lot when I need to chill and take a break from more intense games.

This game will always have a special place in my heart. As a Thai person, you have zero chances to be able to go skiing. Fortunately my Austrian dad was able to give me these experience. Now that my dad have passed away. This is the only way that I could experience skiing again. Thank you for the amazing game.

If you have money to spare, and you like open-world games to chill out on, this is the game for you. I was always reluctant to purchase Steep because of the hefty price, but recently found a good deal.
If you ever played the game "Amped" from the original Xbox, then definitely give Steep a go. I love these type of games, they differ from everything else out there. Everyone enjoys something different every now and then.
Give it a go.
Update: As I have been playing a bit more of this game I'm starting to find downsides. You have to pay for probably the best content available (ramps etc). The games realistic about its map. But I wish there was more ramps etc like there was on Amped.

Best game to play when you're bored and trying to figure out what other game you should play.

game is fun to play with friends. I have no friends.
10/10 would recommend

Turn on some music, sit back, and relax. That is the only way to play this game. If you follow those steps you will really enjoy it.

Beautifully made game, really fun with good bit of progression, leveling to get to different mountains and buying gear. Played a goood bit of beta.
Game runs really smooth, optimised well and haven't seen any bugs yet.
If you're anyway interested in snowboarding/skiing, or just scenery this is an awesome game, only downside is the cost, it's abit "Steep" har har!

So here i am completing a mission where i have to follow this ai, but at one point of the mission we have to climb a hill and jump off a cliff. At this point when we jump off i lose track of the ai and start flying my own way. As i am flying i see another player skiing down the mountain, so i fly towards him and belly flop into the snow. That is where my journey with Wamuel begins.
Wamuel and I after that meeting explored the vast mountains. We completed many missions together and discovered many new places, glitches, challenges, and made snow angels. But there was one challenge that would be the greatest of them all. Wamuel and I reached a mission and it told us to get the summit any way possible and the summit was like 5 mountains away (took around 45 minutes to get too). Wamuel would ski and I would use the snowboard. We glided across mountain ledges and climbed the mountains on foot. We parachuted across the gabs until eventually we made it to the summit. At the summit Wamuel and I saw the sunset and we knew what had to be done. We rode down the mountain we had once tried to reach. As we went down the mountain Wamuel split off never to be seen again. Wamuel will never be forgotten.
But on the flip note this game is great for anybody that likes sandboxes and appreciates sking/snowboarding. Many stories will come from this game that you create and you will meet new people on the summit from every path you choose (also the music is good).

If you're buying Steep don't expect a SSX kind of experience, period. Steep's a shining star in the fact that you have several, fully rendered mountain ranges to explore (vanilla gets you the Alps and Alaska; the Olympics DLC comes with a Japan/Korea range).
It's not a game for most people: unlike many (single-player) games these days, you're not strolled around toward your end-goal, the game is what you make of it - you can always participate in events such as races or freestyling, but the fact that you can teleport yourself anywhere in a mountain and create your own line is what truly makes this game great.
One thing that might draw you away from Steep is that it is always online. I didn't find this to be much of an impediment - even if you don't have internet access at a given time, you can still explore the map, although unable to participate in any of the aforementioned events (should also mention that there is no lag at all, so no issues there).
I might also add that once you ski(/snowboard) in real life, this game becomes much much better. At least in my case, it brought up some valuable memories that make Steep a rewarding and, really, memorable, gaming experience.
So, in conclusion, is it worth buying? If you're not willing to go out of your way to explore the map and play for yourself, yes, but it's not going to be worth the full price cost. The game has a lot of content but it's certain to get boring quite fast if all you're doing are races. Wait for a sale. If however you're going to experience Steep the way it was meant to be experienced, through exploration, then go right ahead. The game will keep you hooked for some time, and will then become somewhere you can cool off after a hard day's work.

Don't get me wrong, STEEP is an amazing game. I used to play this game on Xbox and I can confirm that this is the perfect game to sit back and relax to. It's just a shame that due to Ubisoft's convoluted method of authenticating ownership of the game, I was not able to play STEEP at all through Steam. I have followed through all the troubleshooting steps Ubisoft has provided to customers in this matter, and I can confirm that it is futile. This is the second time Ubisoft's aggravating authentication system has stopped me from playing a game through Steam, and the fact that this issue, although abundant, is not addresses in detail by Ubisoft (at least not in a way that is easily accessible) is the most insulting part of this purchase.
TL;DR - Buy with caution, you may not be able to play at all, let alone receive meaningful help in the matter!

I'm going to just wing(suit) this review off the top of my head after playing it for some time. I think this is one of my favorite games of all time. It's an artistic, digital masterpiece paying great homage to the genre of extreme mountain sports. Do you want to get EXTREME? Play this game.
I don't think the DLC is worth the money. All of my playtime has been done on just the base game and I feel like I still haven't made the best out of the games huge open world. I'm not really an objective player in open world games, I just like to do what I want. This game hits the nail on the head with that. After some time I've easily achieved max level and unlocked everything in the game just by free-riding and exploring wherever I wanted to go.
First of all, I'm a graphics guy. I love playing this game with the settings maxed out and playing on my 120hz refresh rate TV with a controller. It's so immersive. The little details from the varying depths of snow and carving a trench through powder, kicking up chunks and splashes of snow, to standing on the edge of an exposed slope and watching the sun slowly melt the snow textures and turn it into ice. The attention to detail in this game is really amazing. I also love being able to dynamically change the position of the sun on the map and switch it from night to day. In the Alaska map which is free and not a DLC, you can look up at the sky and actually see the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights), and they look real!
The mountains are HUGE. Sometimes it can take fifteen or twenty minutes to reach the bottom in a straight shot. You pretty much have the freedom to go wherever you set your eyes on, regarding that you stay within the boundaries, which are MASSIVE, square kilometers. I love starting at the top of any peak of my choice and deciding which direction to go, and just going wherever my eyes take me. Finding and creating your own lines in this game really expands the creativity of the player. I've sat down for hours just finding the most creative jumps that I thought I'd never be able to land. With enough practice and hundreds of attempts later, you can land what you thought was impossible at first. It's really a great feeling.
The map design is really incredible. The two main maps which are huge and IMO more than enough to not buy any DLC, are modeled after the real Swiss Alps and the Denali National Park in Alaska. Here you'll find real life peaks, and get to ski, snowboard, wingsuit or parachute down them, whichever way and whatever way you want. The way these mountains are set up is there is feature after feature, cliff after jump, set up all over, so you can be SO creative and link them together in whichever fashion that you want to. There is such an amazingly satisfying ebb and flow to this game. I always just put on my own favorite music, crank it up and play the most advanced and entertaining "music visualizer" that money can buy. Exploring and finding hidden, awesome features is my favorite part of the game. There's hundreds of ways to go down one mountain, finding them out is all up to you.
The sense of speed that you get in this game makes it feel like a top notch racing game. I wish there was a speedometer in this game because when you are pinning it down a mountain, you are easily breaking 100 mph. You hear the wind start to get intense and whatever you are wearing (jacket, pants, fur coat, etc.) starts to really flutter depending how fast you are going. There's nothing like hitting top speed and sending it off of an impossible feature and touching the stratosphere.
The animations in this game are so fluid, it makes you feel like your character is real. The way your character will spin, grab, and fluently transition from launch, to tricks, to the landing is really something else. I haven't played a game with this good of animations, ever. There's rarely a hiccup. This game is easy to learn and hard to master the trick systems. Sometimes you want to hold a trick as long as possible and you'll either wipe out into a gnarly, back-breaking tumble, or sketchily land it and ride out of it saying "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DUDE." This game perfectly blurs the line between realism and just outright insane hyper-realism through these perfect, life-like fluid animations. Hucking a 300 foot cliff and landing it after bottoming out on your organic shock absorbers feels pretty realistic, and dangerous.
The line tracking and replay system makes doing everything you want in this game a breeze. Every time you make a run, the game records your track in real time, and draws a visual line depicting your last run; so you can rewind to whatever point during that line that you want to. If you find a part of the mountain that you really enjoy, you can save it for later, to always come back to quickly, or to make a challenge of that particular area and post it online for other people to compete with you on. You can also start a replay from whatever point during that run too and have some really good controls over it like change the camera, camera angle and replay speeds, making for some EPIC, cinema quality shots. Some stuff that you see out of the Travis Rice movies. I've gotten into the habit of watching my replays just about after every run because they are so sick looking watching the jumps in slow motion.
The challenges in this game are really well done. Easy challenges allow you to get in the game and start accumulating points to level up and buy gear to customize your character without making you really work for it. Medium challenges are quite the step up, making you really work for some of the challenges and starting to flex the difficulty and raise the skill ceiling of the game, BARELY preparing you to step into the hard challenges. Hard challenges... Hard challenges are sometimes just downright insane. Especially the wing-suit challenges which require you to key-hole mouse sized openings on near impossible gauntlets of death inside of a mountain at terminal velocity. One slight change of pitch and you're smacking into The Matterhorn at warp speed in the most glorious display of suicide ever seen. I've spent a few hours replaying one short challenge, over, and over again, only to say ♥♥♥♥ it and try something else. Even after I logged in a couple of hundred hours of game time. The hard challenges will keep you busy for a while and it's one of those things that frustrates you, yet you can't put it down and keep going back for more.
I like the multiplayer part of this game for the sheer fact that when you're doing free-riding, you can come across someone else on the same part of the map and naturally they will follow you, or you will follow them, and do a little showing off. It feels like skiing in real life with one of your friends or following some cool stranger down the mountain because he chose a really fun line. I've met some great friends in this game just by doing that. If being a hermit is your thing, don't worry, other players are minimally-invasive and can't ruin your time, even if they try. And the mountain is so big that you don't even have to see them if you don't want to.
The customization is great. There are hundreds of customizations and dozens of ridiculously silly costumes like a blow up T-Rex and a Giraffe with a long ass neck. You can customize your character, gender, jacket, pants, goggles, hats, gloves, backpacks, tools, boots, ski's and snowboards, wing-suits, parachutes, etc... They have everything to fit everyone's style. Some of the costumes are amazingly cool and have their own animations and sounds, but they are expensive. I've ground quite a bit only to satisfyingly unlock the costume of my choice and be amazingly happy at how silly and funny the animations and sounds were. Nothing like sending it off a giant back-country booter as a giraffe and watching his long-ass neck torque and turn down to land, experiencing several g-forces in quadruple-cork, eight-rotation 2880.
BUY THIS GAME

Steep is one of my go to relaxing games. It's fun, there's no pressure, there are ton of different activities to do, and the open world component allows you spend endless hours just messing around.
If you enjoy games like Tony Hawk, Skate, SSX, or anything similar, Steep is probably the best iteration of these types of games.
Posted: December 24, 2016
I bought this game on the winter sale, for what I feel was a fair price. This game is a cross between EA's SKATE and SSX 3 (for the old PS2). Like SKATE, this game takes a serious approach to extreme sports, the tricks can be difficult to pull off and some of the 'lines' (read: levels) are a bit tough, but it is also rewarding. Like SSX3 you get to ski from the top of a gargantuan mountain range to the very bottom, without loading... Seriously no load. You can transport from one end of this insanely large mountain range to the other in a click of a button and it doesn't even load. Bam you're there, bam you're skiing, boarding, skydiving, whatever you want. Well worth the price I paid for it on sale.

Very fun gameplay. The player physics are realistic and the soundtrack is good. A perfect game for calming down after a bad CS:GO match.
Posted: July 9, 2018
The gameplay is a lot of fun but i am constantly being reminded that i can not do everything because i do not have any DLC for the Game. I will do base game missions only to be told my next mission should be a DLC mission which i have not bought. Overall the game is fun but i don't recomend it because it just seems like they are after your money with the constant recomendations of DLC content being your next mission.

Steep is a weird game. A love letter to exploring the picturesque Swiss Alps by way of extreme sports, it toes the line between realism and Red Bull guzzling, MTV goofiness. It's built for scale and spectacle, but digging deeper to actually play the game can feel like you're on a team of beta testers, sharing challenges you pulled out of your♥♥♥♥♥and turning a blind eye to the glaring glitches and rough edges. It suffers from an identity crisis; one minute you'll be paragliding peacefully above a glacier while your avatar narrates a somber diary of conquering the wilderness, fighting oxygen deprivation and dehydration. Then you'll be following a literal ghost rider through the mouths of Ubisoft's Raving Rabbids mascots or being lectured by a stereotypical New York agent for not hitting enough “sick” kickflips. Or a mountain will try to intimidate you, reciting some Robert Frost style poetry. Steep is best played with an open mind. A really open mind...
The game can be stunningly gorgeous; the scale of the mountain range is very impressive and boasts some of the most realistic looking representation of snow I've seen. The glittering of the sun off of fresh powder in particular is approaching levels of photorealism. The detail of your character is quite sharp as well, especially considering the vast amount of unlockable accessories available to outfit him/her in. Traversing the frozen environment also leaves convincing tracks as you sink into the drifts, climbing steep slopes to reach points of interest. An applaudable amount of work and artistry went into the snow, but some of the elements surrounding it look out of place. Rocky surfaces can look like smears painted with a broad brush, often visibly, hastily thrown together at artificially rough angles and clipping through each other. Trees and glaciers are carbon copies of each other, leading to stretches of boring, repeating terrain. But the large scale picture is the reason for playing, and these are the compromises of a completely open, load-free playground.
You have five modes of transport at your disposal: skiing, snowboarding, paragliding, wing gliding, and walking. Skiing and snowboarding are similar and the challenges that feature them are interchangeable. You have very simple controls with these two: steer with the left stick, the right stick cuts sharply, you hold and release jump to ollie, and from there you can spin and grab. For the most part, though, you're at the mercy of the mountain; it's incredibly difficult to make quick adjustments and it can be a struggle to get your avatar to do what you want to do without serious effort. You have no control over the camera, and that becomes an adversary; jamming to the right trying to hit a checkpoint can easily be undermined by a wild, uncontrollable swing or zoom because the game felt like it. You certainly don't have Tony Hawk/SSX levels of control, which is fine, but what's in Steep is better described as “loose” than simulation. After about twenty hours of playing I felt adjusted to the game's quirks, but more often than not trying to get your rider to generally perform something specific still comes down to trial and error, combating the controls, and a good amount of luck. You're provided with a G-meter that is supposed to track how much punishment you can take before you spill, but in practice the game just does what it wants; a ten second free fall onto solid rock might be okay, but hitting what appears to be a pebble may or may not send you into a knockout faceplant.
Wing gliding is the highlight. Flying inches above the ground, weaving around snow covered trees and sharp rocks is exhilarating and it controls responsively. Most of the challenges in the wing suit revolve around passing through rings and gives a serious Pilotwings vibe. Paragliding is more relaxed and is the preferred method for exploring the Alps, allowing you to cover large swaths of land and soak in the sights while you're at it. You're given a very generous updraft system: get close and kinda/sorta perpendicular to a mountainside and there will always be uplift, essentially allowing you to glide endlessly. I'm pretty sure that's not how wind works, but whatever. Walking is where you put one foot in front of the other to initiate locomotion, and while on foot you can use binoculars to spot drop zones and places of interest.
The scale and freeform exploration is great, but the “game” part of the game, the challenges, are all over the place. These events are scattered all over the mountains and they're generally races against the clock or score based affairs. They are categorized into Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties, and you can earn bronze, silver, or gold medals depending on your performance, which awards XP to level up to unlock drop zones and currency to buy cosmetic items. The open nature of the game itself wrecks havoc with any scoring conventions; a single, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t trick pulled out of your♥♥♥♥♥can destroy a gold medal challenge in seconds. Alternatively, a glitchy camera can be a repeatable bane to finishing a race without ragdolling down a cliff face, and the difference between a gold medal or complete failure can either be a matter of minutes or seconds. There's very little consistency between which challenges will be a fun exercise in sharpening your skills or controller throwing frustration.
And that's Steep broadly speaking. It demands to be enjoyed with a relaxed demeanor and forgiving nature from a zoomed out perspective. If you can find that zen state it's one of the best extreme sports games that's released in years. Just don't look at it too closely.
Overall I give this game an 8/10.

This has been up there as my favorite games for several years, Ive collected many of the season outfits, and the physics and multiplayer are awesome,
BUT
no more multiplayer "To protect the community"
Definately not worth it to play alone, that is no fun.
Good job ubisoft, you ruined it, maybe so more people will buy the pile of trash that is riders republic.

Had great fun with Steep, while it lasted. It has no replay value, in that you actually can't restart the game. It's an always-online game that doesn't let you reset your progress.
I can't stress enough how infuriating this is, because I really like this game. I would get ridiculous amounts of replay value out of it, if I could only reset my progress.
Apart from that, my only complaints are minor. The music sucks - with few exceptions, it's agressively bad. I usually just turn it all the way down and run Spotify in the background anyway, though.
I must say I can't recommend this game until they fix the reset issue. I bought this game, I didn't rent it - I'd like to play it more than once.
Regarding the "delete local save files and disable cloud save sync" solution - It doesn't work. Your progress is tied to your Uplay account and stored on the Steep servers, not through Ubisoft's cloud sync - I've tried all the hacks I could find, to no avail.
Regarding the recent update and removal of the level cap - Not good enough, I'm afraid. I'm still faced with a mountain full of challenges I've already completed when I log in - I couldn't care less about progressing through levels if it doesn't mean unlocking new peaks or challenges. Going through the challenges one-by-one and conquering them was the fun part, not trying to marginally best my own score. New seasonal challenges are on the way, yes, but the point stands - what I'm asking for is not unreasonable. Some support threads have indicated there was once a "reset progress" button in game options - the removal (or willful exclusion) of this feature reeks of a shameless money-grab, pushing the player to spend unreasonable sums on DLC ($30? Honestly?) to achieve the feeling of progression again.
It's clear Ubisoft's developers are supporting the game and responding to feedback, and that's more than I can say for a lot of games - I have to give them props (and thanks) for that. But I'm still bitter about this one silly feature that should be a no-brainer.

My favorite open world racing game.
Pros:
Snowboards
Snow
Cliffs
Wingsuit
Sled
tall mountains
Good music
Cons:
Races are hard later on in the game mostly because I am bad

From ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to Ubigood
Seriously, Ubisoft gave this game a soul. The atmosphere is just great, unlike any sportsgame I've played yet.

Refunded it, Steep goes free on Uplay, Thanks Ubisoft :D

I hit a flawless stunt and instantly came
Posted: February 3, 2018
In terms of gameplay, Steep is not very different from other similar games. Athletes ride on the tracks, beat other people's records and set their own, perform extreme stunts in abandoned mountain villages and fall from steep slopes, but unlike competitors, it gives much more freedom. Although the game presents a fairly realistic physical model, at times the engine still gives a slack.

First of all, i played the first early beta of this game back when it had beta. It was NOT something i would by at that time. Even after the games release i refused to buy it.
After a ski trip with a few friends i reconsidered buying the game, but still didnt.
Now on summer sale 2018 i finally bought everything for 20,99. (all DLC included)
A friend of mine did the same, we both downloaded our game and hopped on Discord.
We made a playlist on Spotify and converted it to Youtube.
We got a bot for our Discord, played some music and set in our adventure.
For the first 2 hours we derped around like lunatics, but after learning the basics we realized this was quite the game, if you have a few friends to play with. Its quite chill to play if you just put on some great music, and talk with some friends, while riding down a mountain side.
We competed in many ways, mostly our own "Freestyle Rides" down cliffs and mountains.
Overall!
Great Graphics
Great Game
Lots of Derp
Play with friends
And hey, if you dont have any friends, you might even make a few ingame, as you do get a lot of group invites from other people ingame.

Steep is probably my all time favorite game but at the same time I cannot recommend it because it is online only. Any interruptions to service kick you from the game in very little time and the game will not reconnect to servers once in offline mode.
Tremendous game hampered by a garbage publisher with garbage policies
Posted: May 1, 2023
This game should be taken down from Steam, it doesn't work. The game is unplayable, the servers are offline? And when I click go offline, it looks for the servers again.
I did some searching and it turns out I am not the only person with this problem, the servers are shut down

A blend of arcade and realistic gameplay, with amaaaaaaaaaaaazing graphics.
I put in 24 in the last 3 days and got Gold on nearly all challenges, and yet still have a bunch of unlocked locations left. The game world is huuuuuuuuge, so there's a bunch of variety. A bunch.
Pros n Nos:
+ Huge world
+ Awesome customization (most things you unlock by getting Gold medals, other things you can buy for ingame points. To put it into perspective, jackets cost up to around 2800 and gloves 600, and at the moment I have around 220,000 points. So I can buy quiiiiite a few things. Remember to get your free stuff from Ubi rewards page (shift+f2 for Uplay overlay.).)
+ Has both serious and funny moments, though probably more funny ones. Gnome hunt comes to mind, the phone call was hilarious, haha.
+ Really good looking game, lets you get more immersed and take in the sights.
+ All kinds of terrain, for all kinds of riding styles. But I think someone from the Dev team has a glacier fetish (there's a LOT of them).
+ 8 playable characters, each with their own voice lines. So you can be the Dudebrah My Man Dude or the old Scandinavian (probably Swedish tbh from his accent) guy with a beard. Press T on keyboard to cheer and howl in a positive way, or press it twice to make either funny or mean remarks when you want to insult your friends or that guy that faceplanted into a rock 3 times in a row.
+ You don't die when you crash, so that's less annoying than SNOW where you die instantly. But you can still die if you take 100 G force, however that requires a super long fall straight down so it's mostly fine. The game is the most arcadey in this sense because you live through falls that would ♥♥♥♥ you up real good irl =P.
+ You can control time of day and ambiance (cloudy, cloudless etc.), makes for some really cool shots and gameplay.
+ Replay feature with cool effects, it's pretty good.
+ Online gameplay that's smooth.
+ 4 different cameras, tho realistically you'll only use either close third person or first person.
+ You can put on an animal mask and make animal noises that are hilarious, bwahhhhhhhhhhhhh.
+ Music effects when during a jump, falling and getting back up, and also different kinds of music for different kinds of events. Serene and calm game ambient when at the top of the main mountain, Blue Stahli when going down the steepest mountain at 120 km/h, F-F-F-F-Freestyler (rock the microphone) when in snow parks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Always online, you can't even play solo without connecting to the servers. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sucks, dude.
- Instanced but people usually disappear when they are 150m away from you, which SUCKS.
- Annoying American that keeps calling you and talking about dumb stuff. Drinking game: take a shot everytime he says "SOME SERIOUS AIR". Have fun getting completely hammered.
- Music once again. It's pretty varied, consisting of 40-50 tracks (my guess) of several genres. However, you can NOT add your own music, which isn't a problem when you can just mute and listen via Winamp or whatever you use. But if you want those sweet effects, then you're out of luck. Not a problem but would want this in the game real bad.
- Another point about music, you cannot select more than 1 genre ingame playlist. It's either all of them or 1 of them. You cannot even select specific songs you (don't) want to listen to, which in my opinion should have been included in a game that wants to charge 56+ euros.
(-) Price, but it's personal opinion. I don't believe in buying games costing more than 30 euros ever, good thing I got it as a gift.
- A LOT of resistance, like a LOT, when riding "against" the slope, or parallel to it.
- There's this INSANELY ANNOYING GRRRRR bug where if you're in the rider customization screen for either too long or you preview too many things (don't know exactly how this happen) suddenly it will seem like the drone flying next to your rider kicks up a bunch of snow, basically you can't see your rider at all cause they're a white sillhouette, and your fps will drop to 5 or so (I run on ultra at 60 fps, for comparison.). FIX PLEZ!
- Game also freezes up and crashes (crashing doesn't happen often though, once or twice a day during my 8 hour sessions). Nice price value, bruh.
Overall thoughts! Great game, you're gonna have fun (probably), ESPECIALLY if you play with friends. However you can always just meet up with random people on top of the mountain and ride with them =). The bad things do not outweigh the good things, so if you think you want it and it's at a good price, get it and enjoy. Fair to mention is that if you don't like free roam games then you might not play for as long a time as others, although there's plenty of challenges to keep you busy by going up the leaderboards and whatnot. I'd give the game a 8/10 on the softer side. Toodles.

Steep is a great game to play while listening to chill music. Let's dive into a pro con list:
Pros:
-2 awesome open worlds with numerous mountains
-controls are solid
-enjoyable trick system (turn off trick safety for best experience)
-good game for relaxing and listening to music; a good change of pace from other games
-great replayability: there's always another line down the mountains to try
-graphics are decent
-awesome locations for Backcountry skiing and snowboarding
-multiple sports
-easy to "make your own fun"
Cons
- not enough challenges, especially in Alaska
-mix of challenges wasn't to my liking (too many challenges for paragliding, wingsuit, and ski racing; not enough for ski/snowboard freestyle imo)
-not enough terrain parks
-online/multiplayer features are pointless
-dlc is pricey
If you're at all interested in this game, pick it up. Snow is a great game for anybody interested in extreme sports.

When I was a child , SSX was one of my favorite games of all time. I had them all, and SSX Tricky made me have an epiphany:
Snowboards are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sick.
Shortly after I purchased a snowboard, and the rest is history. You can say that I love snowboarding just as much as I love video games, if not even more. So obviously, Snowboarding video games are a genre that I have played just about every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ title that gravitates toward the extreme snowsports side. And I will say one thing: this is it. This is the one you've been waiting for, the one with a huge awesome mountain range to explore and ♥♥♥♥ around in to your heart's content. That's why SSX 3 had such a lasting impact on me, I spent more time in that game just riding around as I pleased because I loved it. Steep is very identical to it, you've got characters to select from with unique personalities, drop zones to unlock, and each mountain has it's own sort of weather effect or day/night restrictions to make it feel unique from the others. This is the kind of game where you can start at one single fixed point and play for an entire hour and not get bored because of how many places you can actually go/access from said point, and the wingsuit and paraglider are both much more fun methods of transportation than I had originally thought. And, there's lots to be done in this game.
I'll leave you with this: we're all here cause we like games, but in the same sense that people who have no interest in motorsports will have no interest in racing games, I feel like this game is meant to be appreciated if you're either an enormous fan of wintersports or you ski/snowboard yourself. You'll get that 70 dollar value from this game If it's your thing. I know people with several hundreds of hours on Games like DiRT Rally and PoxNora, because for people like them it fills in a missing gap , a game that truly encapsulates something they love while hitting all the right notes.
I've been waiting for a game like this, and while it may not be perfect (no jibs make me sad) it's definately more than I could ever have asked for from a snowboarding game.

Steep comes at a steep price
It’s been a long time since good snowboarding game released. Steep isn’t anything special, but it’s a good choice for those who missed those good old PSone days.
Steep is more of an arcade game than simulation, it’s not realistic, just crazy tricks at insane speed but it isn’t completely unrealistic, there’s still some sense of logic.
You can choose from several winter sports. Snowboarding, skiing, paragliding and more. There’s even a (overpriced) DLC dedicated to winter Olympics.
Games uses same Ubisoft formula as other games. There’s a huge map with lots of activities and thing to unlock. Unfortunately many things are locked behind DLC’s and some activities are simply too difficult for average players. Nevertheless it still could be fun.
It takes some time to master this game. Controls very nicely done and are pretty intuitive but you’ll need some time to learn all the tricks and land safely. I highly recommend a controller for this game. When you finally make a crazy jump, do some trick while staring at the breathtaking scenery and land on your legs you feel rewarded.
While the game is pretty fun from the first sight, it gets boring pretty fast. You either don’t like some activities or they’re too difficult for you and hit a wall. I wish it had a proper career mode.
Graphically the game looks pretty nice. Could be better but overall it’s pretty to look at. There’s a photo mode with the ability to change lighting and time of day for all the screenshot lovers.
Performance is great, I had no slowdowns or lag, runs very smoothly.
Should I say the price is a little steep? Yep, this game isn’t very popular and Ubisoft still refuses to put it on a good sale and discount the DLC’s. I personally got confused by all the DLC’s. There is more than one season pass and season pass doesn’t guarantee you all the DLC so I just ignored them all. But i must admit Ubisoft took a risk and decided to make a new game and i wish they would this more often.
I wish they would bring this game back to life like they did with Division and For honor and add some free content, something interesting to do. Maybe make DLC’s free. But what am I talking about, it’s Ubisoft...
If you love winter sports this might be a good game if purchased on a deep sale with all the DLC. It gets boring fast, but the core of the game is very nicely done.
Pros
Great controls
Lots of tricks to perform
Good graphics
Cons
Confusing DLC’s/season passes
Gets boring fast

Friends, gamers, countrymen...lend me your ears! I have come here to bury Steep, not to praise it.
Once, Steep was a sublime piece of brilliance...a game where you were rewarded for exploring, for playing, for just enjoying. You did not have anything trying to kill you aside from gravity. Instead, you were given the most majestic mountainscapes to play upon. No lift tickets, no waiting in line for the quad or the gondola. Heck, you didn't even get out of breath and your muscles never tired. It was like Valhalla, if the vikings had been skiers, snowboarders, paragliders and wingsuit maniacs...a never-ending playground of extreme sports and clever challenges.
The physics were great...I've been a skier for over 40 years and the snow *behaves* the way I would expect it to. Turning, stopping, even the way you'd lose speed going up obstacles all acted exactly right. I'd nail a challenge, and then just keep skiing or snowboarding...for miles...until I ran out of downhill. Then, with a few mouse clicks, I was atop some other peak of my choosing and able to do what I felt like, all over again.
And then...THE PATCH. That dreaded December 4th, when Ubisoft did to Steep what Michael Jackson is alleged to have done to little boys. 18 GB of digital murder, after which many of us were asking, "Why won't Steep load?" Two days later, another patch...but no difference. Along with the patch came the opportunity to install their additional Olympic content...but it seems that to Ubisoft, we are all Russians in Steep, and unwelcome at the Olympics. Tale after tale of unhelpful, uncaring customer support. A lack of acknowledgement from Ubisoft of the ongoing problem as hundreds of people post their identical woes in the discussion forums. As though the snow all disappeared in a day, but the stoner operating the chairlift just expected us to keep going up anyways to slide down the barren rock.
The evil that developers do is remembered after their games' deaths, but the good is often buried with them. It might as well be the same with Steep.
Posted: June 11, 2017
I have to say I really enjoy Steep. I don't play it all the time but when im looking to just mess around my son and i who is 5 will do some snowboarding and ill follow him down the mountain or whatever other sport he wants to do. It's a blast and totally worth buying. I also just realized today how to change to alaska which was a whole new open world so up until today ive just been doing the alps. Great game and alot of fun! Easy to get use to playing as well.
Posted: February 6
Great game but having to sign into Steam and a completely different Ubisoft account that sends 67 thousand admin security prompts means it will forever be buried at the bottom of the list of games I don't play.
I cannot understate how frustrating it is to have to sign into the ubisoft account it is so annoying.
Posted: May 2, 2017
My Position: Currently have 66 hours in game and have max level and all achievements.
Summary: Steep is the first AAA title to return to the Extreme Winter sports game scene after the genre ran dry for several years. Developed by Ubisoft, it has many of the drawbacks and advantages that come with being the firs tto return to the genre as well as being devolped by a majopr company.
Buy or no buy? Depends. Here are some pros and cons that I have run into in Steep.
+Pros:
Unrivaled polish for the genre
Graphics are stunnign on max
Great Environment that can be explored pratcially forever
Partial Multiplayer Experience (more later)
Party System (More later)
Decent update rate with more maps and gamemodes coming
Comprehensive Player Customization
-Cons:
THE PRICE
THE OPTIONAL (however surprisingly unobtrusive) MICROTRANSACTIONS
OK party system that caps at 4
Physics that can seem slidy at times
Multiplayer system that often leaves the game feeling empty
Stange Stamina meter physics that makes any good trick feel like complete luck
Incomplete Dare system that won't let you even name your own challenges or share them publicly
graphics that run ok at lower settings but scale very poorly. (i.e. Higher settings become harder to run exponetially)
Points of Interest are almost to compeltely find without a guide (Could be a plus for some, though I doubt it)
2-3 challenges are near impossible to beat (Though many are fixed now)
Conclusion: I am a little harsh on this game, mostly out of love, but also because there are problems with the game that I feel make the game forgetable. Part of the appeal of the extreme sports genre is how timeless they can become and how warmly the people who play them look back on them.
So do I think players will look back on Steep with warm hearts 5-10 from now? NO. While other titles like SNOW (A free to play on Steam) come nowhere close to Steep in terms of quality, I have no doubt that other large game companies are looking at what Steep here and taking note.
Expect to see EA Winter Sports coming soon, as well as other large names entering the field after Steep. Perhaps when gamers go to open their history books, they'll see Steep as the first quirky little seed of a larger green forest.
Thanks for reading. :D
Update: This game is now ok. Bu at the current price, on sale, its worth getting.

Fell off a cliff the size of a skyscraper, pounded my head into a rock, stood up after 10 seconds. In conclusion hyper realistic physics engine. Would smash.

Ubisoft Launcher failed to authenticate after purchase. The game put me in "offline mode" which LOCKED ME OUT OF ALL CONTENT completely invalidating the entire game. Became a brick in my library.
Posted: June 24, 2018
BEWARE: Online only game. You can't even change your hat or anything without waiting till it loads data from the server. The moment it lags or disconnects boom, you are thrown back in the main menu and usually only restart helps so it takes like 3-4 minutes to get back. You can't progress, gain points or play any challenge in offline mode, only free roam without any purpose or progression. It might be more messy and disconnects more because it's on sale now, but that's not an excuse for a company such as Ubisoft. And for some reason you can't pause the game or alt+tab during challenges it restarts it, even though some of them take up to 8 minutes to finish. Bizzare design choice.
Also, if you've been playing Olympics mode and lost connection? Tough luck, last save could have been 30 minutes ago because challenges/missions are chained together.
Really fun and great game that is ruined by microtransactions and online only. Ubisoft at it again. Progression is ruined because you can't access the sports natively. You need to farm for ages for sports. I've played 7 hours bought 1 sport which I ended up almost never playing and now I can't buy any other sport. And some sports cost more than the one I bought.
You have ski/snowboard/wingsuit/paragliding comes with the purchase. 4 other sports sled/jetpack/basejump/rocketsuit can be bought from in-game store using in-game currency or via Season pass. I've only managed to buy sled for 40k points, which is the cheapest one. Jetpack is 100k and I only had 18k points left before I quit the game.
And I played challenges almost exclusively, which is the best way to earn points. Also, you'll run out of easy challenges fairly quick so it will be hard to get gold or silver to get most points out of a challenge. I have no idea how much you need to farm to get all the sports using in-game money. 30 hours maybe more.
They tweaked the progression, so instead of farming for years people would just give up and by them for real money.
So don't fall into this trap, don't bother with the season pass or gold edition, you can buy 4 other sports with in-game currency that you can obtain by playing. Just research about the sport you want to buy first, so you won't be spending points for something you're not gonna play. Winter Games Edition is the one you want.

Steep brings a very good extreme winter sports experience, with several well-developed sports, where the feeling of speed and the stunt system stand out in particular.
The graphic splendor is also simply phenomenal and the game offers a mountain area with many varied missions and opportunities for adventure.
All in all, Steep is definitely recommended for anyone who feels like strapping on their virtual skis this Christmas, or just want to lay in the couch and get some freestyle experience.
The game is also great on a steam deck:

Steep is not SSX, but it does have things that you can't find in SSX.
Steep is a game for both relaxation and competition. It will take hours to days or more before you have discovered all corners of the beautiful world and have all challenges set to gold.
Steep's world looks great. It breathes nature and the atmosphere is very good. The snow is cracking, the wind is howling and the sun is burning. From the moment you start the game, you will be briefly explained how the controls and the game work.
The controls are sometimes a bit questionable, but after you pass the tutorial, you are completely released into the game.
The events are divided into different categories. For example, there are the Bonebreaker events, where you have to exert as many g-forces as possible on your body.
Of course the standard races and trick events cannot be missed. Every challenge is different in its own way, but in the end it all comes down to the same thing.
Either you hurtle down the mountain at a fast pace, or you collect as many points as possible during your journey to the finish. In addition, there are three different levels of difficulty for the different events. You have easy, medium and difficult events. The difference in level is especially evident in the wingsuit activities that sometimes really manage to get the most out of it.
Steep is really a fantastic game that either grabs you from the first moment or manages to keep you completely uninterested.
You have to be able to enjoy yourself and luckily I can do that very well. However, the game is much more fun if you play it with some friends.
This brings a little more competition into the game and gives you an instant goal.
You really feel like you are on the mountain and the vista that constantly fills the screen is breathtaking at all times.

This is the best game ever to play stoned.
Posted: September 17, 2020
let me start by saying this game is fantastic. ubisoft really nailed a lot of things on this game.
However, 75% of the games content is locked behind a paywall. I already payed like 40 dollars for this game a while back and there is basically zero new free content since then. Thats dumb.
Posted: September 27, 2023
This game is really fun but the launcher is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ass.
I had a lot of fun with this game but now Ubisoft launcher says I don't own the game? My Ubisoft account is linked to my Steam account. I basically spent my money for nothing.
Great game
Ass launcher.
I hate Ubisoft.
Posted: November 2, 2017
I think this game sometimes gets a bad rap, but as someone who prefers exploring, and was a huge fan of the old 1080 game on the N64, this fills the niche I'd been looking for. The music is excellent, and the ability to change on the fly is a wonderful addition. It won't take long to become good at this game, and if you're like me, and enjoy the exploration aspects, you'll love this wonderful time waster. If you're looking for a super serious simulation of skiing/snowboarding, there may be other options, but for me this fits the bill perfectly. The graphics are supperb as well, and you'll feel like you're actually "there."
Posted: December 9, 2016
I don't know what happened to Ubisoft lately but it looks like they decided to finally release proper games : Beautiful, well optimized and interesting. Keep up the good work guys.
As for Steep, it might be one, if not the, of the most relaxing games i've played.
The game is beautiful, the open world is huge. Sure, it has is problems like collisions glitches but free roaming around the mountains, discovering new spots, enjoying some rides or just riding while listening to the great OST feels just good.
If you're looking for some SSX like game, pass your way, it's totally different. You won't manage to get some crazy tricks. But if you're patient enough, the trick system is good enough to have fun.
PS : Devs, please add the possibility to remove the HUD.

Initial Thoughts
I played Steep in the Beta a few weeks back and was impressed by it then, I didn't play it a whole lot as I generally don't like burning myself out in beta's before the game is released due to progression getting reset etc. etc.
I've been playing now for the past few hours and the game is excellent, there are still a few things that need sorting but it's well worth the price tag compared to some games that have come out this year.
It's not just your generic snowboard racing game that many dismiss it as, you are free to do what you want, you can create your own challenges, play in a variety of ways (Currently there is skiing, snowboarding, wingsuit and paragliding with more coming soon)
As one who enjoyed SSX at a younger age but since moved to playing more competitive games I am not usually attracted to these sorts of things anymore but the way the game is done is what makes it so unique, it caters for everyone so you can play it as casually or as competitive as you want, like I said above it's more than just a racing game on snow.
G-Force Meter
[Aids]-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10
This could be in gameplay but deserves it's own section.
This is basically a meter which goes up and if it goes too high you fall off but the game does not tell you how it works, what so ever.
This felt gamebreaking in beta and still does in full release, I have noticed on multiple challenges now that start off at high speed leading towards a ramp if you hit a slight bump and get just a milisecond of air time the game gets confused and puts your g force meter borderline "Falling off" so when you do hit the ACTUAL jump your g-force stacks and stack and stacks and RIP goes your line.
This seriously needs re-working and honestly is a massive dampener on what is an awesome game.
Gameplay / Controls
1-2-3-4-5-[6]-7-8-9-10
When it comes to the gameplay / controls side of things I feel this is what really lets Steep down, on keyboard it can feel very out of control at times, you don't have the precision you need on certain challenges which can easily lead to frustration.
It is playable on PC however without a controller (or I wouldn't have bought it in the first place) but if you really want to get the most out of it and get gold in everything / really challenge peoples scores then I do recommend you get a controller.
Sadly in typical Ubisoft fashion it seems they catered for console first and PC was a bit of an after thought.
Visuals
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-[9]-10
It's gorgeous, hands down one of the best looking games of the year, my steam link arrived yesterday so I am quite looking forward to settling down on the sofa (once I get a controller) and enjoying this bad boy on my 50inch.
It's hard to really talk about visuals really but if you look at any media of the game you can see for yourself, better than I can describe in words anyway.
I've yet to see any graphical glitches.
Dropped a point as at nightime the slopes can be insanley dark, but they're supposed to be, I am nit picking.
Sound
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-[10]
Loving the sound in the game, the music is very fitting and not intrusive, it makes enjoying the slopes relaxing and the challenges intense but get you pumped as you are hurtling down at breakneck speeds.
Also noticed that each costume has different taunts, I have just unlocked the giraffe costume and if I press T I can make it squeek, pretty funny when zooming past someone with your long neck flopping about in the wind.
Overall
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10
Overall I can highly recommend this game, even if you have just a slight interest in snowboarding / snow sport games now or in the past you will find something to love in Steep.
There is plenty of replayability and "Holy sh*t" moments, I find myself saving clips and playing about with the replay editor constantly.
The community in game also seems very inviting, whilst I was chilling on top of a mountain I was constantly being invited by people wanting to ride together.
There is plenty of content to unlock, loads of challenges and hidded secrets with plenty of progression.
Loses points due to the horrible g-force meter and really requires a controller to enjoy it fully.

I don't care about the price and all the DLCs, since this game is obviously beautiful and wonderful. I simply fell in love with the surrounding nature, sounds, the atmosphere... I wish I had a chance to visit one of these amazing mountains once in my life!

Best sports title ever. Also it's one of the best titles of Ubisoft as well. Lets count what is good what is bad
+3 Huge maps, i mean they are really full and big
+Tons of challenges
+Different type of sports. Ski, snowboard, paraglide, wingsuit, rocket wingsuit, speed riding, sled, base jumps. You can walk too
+Tricks are fun and seriously easy to master (with controller)
+Im using xbox controller and my experience was perfect with this game. So smooth controls
+Optimization is simply perfect. Used ultra with 1080p and MSAA 4x+ . Had 100 fps minimum. used 2060super
+There are no stupid graphic settings and limitations.
+Accessibility is so easy, you can teleport every single challenge.
+Menu Ui also good
+Soundtracks are mostly good. Some of them so annoying but its ok
+Graphics, environment, scenes. They are infinitely perfect
+You can spend a lot of hours with that
+Constant updates, they are bringing more contents monthly or weekly
+Too many skins (not necessary for me)
+0 crash, almost no glitches or bugs. (suprisingly, because of ubisoft. But this game sponsored too many important events and brands. Maybe they cared that game so much)
+Multiplayer and its fun
+Open world pvp, you may encounter random players in world.
-Some rewards are broken. When you win a challenge, the cosmetic rewards are popping up but in character section you cant find it. This is mess yes but like i said above; skins are worthless anyway. And there are still countless skins.
-There are too many DLC's. Most of them good but they are selling them separately. Well this is the most common problem todays gaming..
-Ubisofts overlay and achievement system. Like you guess its broken
Overall its magnificent game. Do not forget this game designed for singleplayer time/score run. You will not get disappointed because this game is really good. Gonna review dlcs too.
10+/10

Steep is a godsend in my game library.
Have you ever wanted to play an in depth game, but you're too stressed or too salty to play games that require your full attention? This game is my solution.
When balancing college and life and the desire to game, you find your desire to game is only met with frustation. Steep is my go to "Rest and Relax" game where I can just launch it up, and slide down a big ass mountain repeatedly and just see what cool stuff i can do. Enjoy the music, take in the scenary, maybe try to 1up my high scores on some challenges.
The game shines when you have a friend or two to play with. you meet up on the mountian, to a challenge or create a dare and see if your friends can do better and take that gold away from you. It turns into hours of simply trying to get better at that one path, or get more points on that jump youre so close to beating.
The game itself is full of personality and doesnt hold back in the fun factor. Strap a fish to your head, wear an inflatable sumo suit. Heck, wear a yeti outfit and chase other skiiers and just yell at them by pressing A :I a lot.
one of the DLCs gives you a jetpack and an old fashion sleigh.
MUST HAVE A CONTROLLER

Product refunded
REFUND
"In Windows 10, Player will not receive any input from the in-game menu if his Xbox One controller is connected through Bluetooth." Thats a official quote from Ubisoft.
They know this bug exists and didnt patch it...

Over all, a really solid game. The game has some really great graphics, a good feel when you're tearing up the snow, and the ability to play different sports like snowboarding, skiing, wingsuit flying, rocket wingsuit, and paragliding. There is also some others you can unlock by playing the game and through DLCs.
The game is great by itself, plenty of different challenges to do and the Mountain Stories are surprisingly engaging. The game is also a blast with friends as you tumble down the mountain side-by side.
There is a couple things from keeping as just a great game, rather than a fantastic game. I think the game would benefit from an offline mode where you can do things alone on the mountain, that way an internet connection isn't required. Also, some type of ability to change the controls or allow camera movement. If I have a friend snowboarding behind me, I can't see him. Something like pushing R3 to look behind would be useful. While you're moving, the right analog stick is also used for sharper turns, so there is no camera movement there. Although I like the extra control, I do miss the ability to use the camera.
Online community is a little dead, but it doesn't really make a difference. If you're into this type of sport, this game is definitely worth it, I would recommend picking it up on a sale.

X-games DLC no longer exists so dont buy the gold edition buy base and get the DLC accordingly. I bought the Gold thinking I'm getting the best but its not really. I enjoy the game and am not ragging but they're other games that don't have Ubi problems.
Edit: This taking away of DLC has had me so confused. One of the X-Games DLC is gone but one is there and available. $10 is fair for gold edition but honestly, I paid for all content and it should be there. Also the whole Japan thing has me baffeled.
Posted: June 25, 2017
Awesome graphics and fun but slightly repetitive gameplay. This game is very fun. Dont get me wrong tho....it can be really repetitive and some people really really hate that. I dont tbink its worth 60 personally....but i picked it up for 20 and its well worth the 20 bucks imho.

Steep is a deeply underrated game.
For me, it's not about extreme sports, it's about the totality of the experience. I played SNOW for a good and long time, setting myself atop the highest peak and rolling downhill just relaxing and listening to the sounds of the wind.
Steep bolsters this same feeling with an immense world for you to explore, it's these kinds of games where I feel most at peace. Not only is there immense fun in exploring, but if you can convince a friend to play with you, I promise you'll lose track of time. This is truly one of the most unique game experiences in AAA gaming.
It's immensely hard to explain with words, just give it a shot.

Fun, easy, and relaxing. Quality except for Winterfest DLC. That can go fall off a tall cliff as far as I'm concerned.
Posted: January 3
I've played for hundreds of hours on console, and had to re-purchase Steep on PC to play again. This is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time, everything about it is about as perfect as you could expect. Holds up extremely well as a 2016 release, is better than most new releases now. Play it, you won't regret it.
Posted: February 21, 2022
Good game to buy but only while it's on sale. Never gets updates anymore and it gets ridiculously cheap when it's on sale even with all the DLC. I think I've played this game for 1K plus hours on PS4 and it's such a good game with so much content to explore. Although I do think it takes a certain kind of person to enjoy this game.
8/10 So many lines to ride and fun DLC content but the game is kind of abandoned by the devs after Riders Republic came out.

I picked this game up on sale for $14.99. I was expecting to have issues with it...I mean come on...It's UbiSoft! But after playing it for a few hours, I don't know why this game gets all the negative attention its getting from people...I am not really big into winter games. But the graphics are way better than I was expecting, the tricks aren't that hard, you can even have safety on for tricks to help you not wreck as much, and learn when to actually try and do tricks at the right time. Yes, you need to have a UPlay account.
I have a bunch of games from UbiSoft so Uplay isn't an issue for me. I absolutely love the attention to detail this game has. I have NO ISSUES whatsoever. Why all the negatvie comments? No clue...But It's a beautiful expansive world with breathtaking views, I get so into the game when I do large drops sometimes I find myself holding my breath, almost like I'm expecting to feel the impact. I'm taking pictures like crazy. I love going through my run in slow mo and watching my character glide through the snow and doing tricks off jumps.
Not to mention it is funny as hell watching your player rag doll down the mountain side after miscalcualting your landing a tad, sounds like crunching of bones, and your ski's and poles go flying. It is a bit tricky using the wingsuit, it's a bit tough to get used to and trying to skim your hands or feet in the snow as you glide is as dangerous as it is in real life. If only they had like X-Rays showing you when you break bones, and a hospital bill describing the extent of all your injuries after major falls, would be cool...if only just to see how badly you hurt yourself.
I love that you can stop using equipment and walk or jog around. I think it's a bit funny that you can practically climb a sheer cliff face with no climbing tools whatsoever Just run straight up, and across almost flat vertical surfaces. I don't know what specs the people who are having issues are running, but I have a good system. I have no issues whatsoever. I'm running windows 10, my resolution is 3840x2160, Ultra settings I will definitely be getting the DLC for this and will have lots more hours invested learning the mountains and trick sets. I highly recommend this game if you like winter sports games, or any kinda of sports games in general, with some amazingly realistic graphics.

Y’know, i really enjoy this game, even to this day, but micro transactions and season passes in a $60 game is unacceptable. The game is already overpriced as it is, but to actually enjoy all the game has to offer, you’ll have to spend at least $100. For what you get out of it, just don’t waste your money.
Posted: December 6, 2016
Incredible game. Scratches the Skate 3 "itch".
Few tips:
Controller highly recommended
Turn trick safety off
Don't hold forward the entire time
Let go up sticks in the air to catch flips

Bought it knowing it was online only with the only offline mode available being freeroam. However, just 30 minutes into the game and the game really shows you how much you'll lose out on when (not if) Ubisoft ever shuts the servers down. No challenges, no progression, no dropzone finding, nothing. That's assuming the game will even let you run it when it goes down.
Don't buy online-only games, especially from Ubisoft who won't let you play games you paid for after their online drm can't authenticate the game.
Refunded. I buy games to play them later, sometimes even years later.
