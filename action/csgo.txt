After 8 years playing it, I didn't improve my skills in-game.
However, I learned new language skills: now I can curse in Russian and Brazilian Portuguese.
Also, my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased.
Now I can bear the crying of my children for longer and I can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures, such as Очи чёрные (Dark Eyes) or Garota de Ipanema (The Girl from Ipanema).
In conclusion, Counter Strike transformed me into a better father and a better person, in addition to making me more patient, tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures.
Better than any psychiatric therapy. 10/10

The time I spent playing this game could've been spent...
...studying
...applying for jobs
...making friends irl
...getting a wife
...spending time with my family
...working out
...becoming a better man in general
From the time I spent in this game, I got...
...an extremely racist and homophobic vocabulary
...free Russian lessons
...anger management issues
...borderline autistic tendencies
...sleep deprivation
10/10 would never uninstall this game and correct my life
P.S. PLEASE for the love of all that is holy, practice in Deathmatch and Casual as well as perfect your cross-hair and mouse sensitivity before you jump into competitive. People will thank you for it.

In order to play this game you need to be the wolf. You need to know how to howl, in fact you need to be capable of howling at will, unleash that warrior howl with your mind. Then eat raw meat, learn to adore having your fur stroked and PREY ON THE SHEEP! Because we thrive in a land where the strong prey on the weak and that's called natural selection, THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A WOLF. Don't let the sheep's bleating prevent you from enacting your genetic will, YOU MUST GNAW ON THEM. Tear them strip by strip and show them that the Úlfhéðnar do not take thralls.

I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.
I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.

No wonder CS is 20+ years old. This game is so addictive. I was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion. This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun. Rumours say CS:GO is going to shift on Source 2 Engine within 2 weeks, really excited for it.
When you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them. Always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners. I know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm & make sure to teach the beginners. Our community is already toxic, lets not make it more.
You win or you learn, you never lose.
CS will never die.
Edit: Source 2 is still not out. You can play on 128 tick rate servers on third party clients like FaceIt, ESEA, 5E Play etc.

Valve did an Activision-Blizzard, and force upgraded everyone playing CS:GO to play "Counter Strike 2" -- so Valve which is it a sequel or a major patch??
On top of that they replaced the store page so all the millions of reviews and stats are now attributed to CS2 even though they were earned by CS:GO, underhanded and disgusting behaviour.
I expect better from Vavle of all companies. I cannot support this.

Joke review? There's too many, here is the truth.
This is the game that:
You love to hate
You can't sleep at night over
You throw things around the room
You scream at your monitor
You start yelling at people that come in your room and start asking questions
You get ridiculed just for playing a match
You are cheered on by your team
You get flashed by your teammate
You meet children
You meet adults
You meet adults that act like children
You learn the term "tked" the hard way
You are constantly called a kitty cat
You are told you are homosexual
You are told you are lesbian
You are told you will never be a pro despite never trying to be one
You are told you will never be a minor despite never trying to be one
You are told you will never win a lan despite never trying to enter one
You apparently live in your mom's basement
You find out your mom has been having some strange relationships
You find out your dad has been having some strange relationships
You are recommended to drink bleach
You learn you are autistic
You try to ruin someone's internet/real life
You watch people get bans for tking
You meet the most terrible people on the internet
You meet queued people that just look forward to kicking you before the win (If solo queued)
You are held to high degree by your team to clutch everything even 1v4s
You learned the term "clutch or kick" the hard way
You are told you suck even though you have way more kills/kdr than them
You are called a hacker for listening to footsteps
You are told the bomb is B when it is actually A
You pop out of an angle only to get one shotted
You hit sweet sweet flicks
You can't aim worth ♥♥♥♥
You hear the classic excuse "I'm not even trying bro"
You turn racist/culturist
You find the DJs
You find the soundboard bros
You find the most strategic people you will ever meet in a game
You realize you are a rage quitter
You lash out to other people who lash out to you
You try to calm others down

You meet people who watch youtube vids and think that's the only way the plan can go
You meet people who think the team should die for them so they can get the kills
You get screwed from people leaving your team
You find people that just like to afk grief and watch your team lose and probably laugh
You find people not skilled enough to play their ranks so they throw the match and derank down
You get in a match and someone needs to go afk for 5-15mins or leave
You play overpass
You realize playing overpass was a terrible choice
You get connection errors
You get screwed over by your IP and get a cooldown ban
You meet people who lag purposely
You win some
You lose some
You tie some
You rank up
You rank down
You Ace
You don't get a kill for a long while
You become top fragger
You become bottom fragger
You go 16-0
You go 0-16
You learn the maps
You find out you didn't really learn said maps
You find people calling out to help the team
You find people with no mics to help out the team
You find people with mics that bought the cheapest mic possible
But yet in all the madness somehow it is ok....
You get back on the next day and go through the same roll of ♥♥♥♥ again and you do it with a smile.. at least when you start.
That my friends is a game that will carry on with you forever.

After 100 hours I knew the basics of the game and the guns available
After 200 hours I threw away the knowledge of all guns and sprayed the P90
After 300 hours I clicked on people's heads with an SG
After 400 hours I was bad and abandoned ranked
After 500 hours I played wingman on Lake
After 600 hours I partook in an additional mild quantity of the winged male upon the realm by the Lake
After 700 hours I was silver 1 in wingman
After 800 hours I started playing on 130 ping to contain my sheer ability and flawless aim to give the rest of the community a chance
After 900 hours I have become a master of the arts in using a nova on 130 ping and the world trembles as I kill countless awptists with a swift burst of hot metal straight to the temple
Maybe once I hit 1000 hours I'll finally get out of silver
Now I got out of silver and I'm running straight back, hopefully I'll get back there by 1500

I started playing this game when I started to get depressed IRL.
I made a lot of friends and got to know that I was actually a likeable human being.
People seemed to be happy and excited to play with me.
I called them friends and they helped me simply by existing and being happy with me.
I grew confident, learnt I was actually a bit fun to talk with.
This game made me discover myself and I forever will be thankful for that.
The thing that makes this game what it is are the people, you'll meet a LOT of them it's upto you to choose who to keep playing with and who to forget and forgive.
The people i met through this game are some of my lifelong friends and I am lucky to have those friends.
I may not play this game everyday now but this game holds a dear and special place in my heart.
At the final moments of this game I edit this to say, thanks for everything you have done for me.
It may be just a game for many but for me it was one of the way to escape from my reality, to get to meet some of my life long friends and to get to know the world and myself more.
Thanks ,
From the most Bottom and sincere part of my heart.
I will always miss and remember the time I have spent with a big smile.
