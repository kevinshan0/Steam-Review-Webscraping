This game is one thousand games in one.
Graphics: 6/10 (But this was made in 2004 and you can download mods to make it look better)
Gameplay: 9.5/10 (There is literally no limit)
Ease of play: 7/10 (Basic controls are easy, but it gets more complicated the more you want to do)
Multiplayer: 9/10 (Everything is better when you're doing it together)
Replayability: 9/10 (There is literally no end to the things you can do in this game)
Community: 7/10 (Some people are awesome, some are total jerks, it still doesn't ruin multiplayer though)
Overall: 9/10 (Just buy it already will you?)

This is game is an all time classic for the Steam community,
Developed by Facepunch,Published by valve.
There are infinite possibilties in this game,
-become a millionaire and buy whatever you please on a dark rp server
-Play Star wars rp and waste your entire life on it.(My hours say it all)
-Play prop hunt one of the more notable game modes
-Trouble in terrorist town is a classic,Most notably made popular by SeaNanners
If it wasnt for GMOD I wouldnt have met so many people who I have befriended.This game if just perfect for anyone who is looking to meet genuine nice people (and the casual ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•) and literally talk for hours about games,Life and just things in general.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From Here I've added a bit :P

I waited 2 hours for the "My Little Pony Furry Player Models" to download for a Serious Military Role playing server. Once I finally got in I was lectured on their rules for another hour, was forced to take an actual test and then finally I got disconnected from the server. After another hour to rejoin I finally got back in and was lectured again and forced to take the test again. After all of that I played on the server for 4 minutes, called one of my fellow new players a little baby. They revealed them self as a hidden admin and banned me for staff disrespect, indefinitely.

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is

If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them.
If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone.
If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it.
If you don't have the money for it, get a job.
If you don't have a job, rob the bank.
If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

When my friends ask me what my favorite game of all time is they always expect me to say either one of the Witcher games, or Fallout, or any other AAA title, and they are always suprised when they get Garry's mod as the answer. I grew up on this game. Days home from school "sick" , rainy weekends, normal afternoons.. I was always here. It was my routine. My comfort. TTT, surf, sandbox, a little prop hunt now and then...
Some of the best moments of my life came from this game. I know, i know. Pathetic right? But i've made some of the most important friendships i've ever had on this game. It was my home for 5 years. and i regret nothing. This game may seem simple and maybe even a little stupid. But that's the point y'know? a simple thing for you and possibly some friends, new or old enjoy. I miss it. I miss the good times. Hopefully this review will make someone buy it, and then they'll learn what i've been talking about. It's an amazing thing.

Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.
"Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...
_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.
_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.
_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.
_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.
_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.
Gameplay: 9/10
Graphics: 7/10
Story: N/A
Sound: 8/10
Replayability: 10/10
Overall 8.5
Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod

Gets a little boring after 2000 hours.
Garry's Mod is genuinely one of the best games out there though and it's a must have on every steam account. Well worth the price but it goes on sale pretty often.

I've been playing since 2012 it's pretty ok
Posted: January 24, 2023
Before I played Garry's Mod, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things haven't changed, but the game is pretty good

Can't you afford the new cyberpunk 2077 or Back 4 blood?
Do you want every game available on Steam and/or Playstation Network in a single game?
Can't you afford ssome cash to build your own PC at least 300$,?
Do you have a low end PC made for highschool purposes?
Then fear not, the Garry's Mod is made for all your solutions!

5 reasons to get this game
1. It's not very expensive at only $10, sometimes lower during sales
2. Most of its content is entirely Community-Sourced (great addons like ARC9 Base or gm_backrooms)
3. There are multiplayer servers (if you want multiplayer FPS and RP)
4. The sandbox aspect of it works on so many different levels
5. It's not Overwatch 2

One of the best games I have ever played. I bought it on a whim, years ago, so I could try my hand at building things. That purchase is the best I have made. After 2.5k hours, I can say you will not get bored of this game. Not only do you have the base gamemode of sandbox, allowing you to spawn NPCS, build, and do pretty much anything you want, you also have tons of multiplayer servers and workshop addons to choose from.
Feel like playing a World War 2 Role Playing game? Gmod has a server running it.
Want to be a clone trooper in the Star Wars universe, and earn ranks and combat ability? Gmod has a server running it.
Perhaps you want to play a RTS? Maybe a murder mystery game? Hide and seek? Racing? Yup, Gmod has it all.
Gmod is thousands of games for the price of one, and it is worth it 100%
Trust me, you will NOT get bored of this game.

Over 6,700 hours on this game. I'd say it's pretty damn good.

Even after so many years Garry's Mod is still the best Source Engine Sandbox out there.
Thanks to an endless amount of community made mods and game modes there is always something to do.
Or you can just goof around with assets and see what will happen!

It's a good game to replace your life with.
Cake's guide to losing your life in Gmod: Extended Title Edition
1. Find game mode you like or tolerate.
2. Find server that has quality of life things for game mode
3. Spend 400 - 1000 hours on the server
4. Make many friend on server during this time
5. Eventually the server dies or you get bored
6. Revisit casually to server-hop, never as satisfied as you once were.

The game is great.
I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam. People do that to trick you into giving you steam points (the steam currency) by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, lies and deceipt.
"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I have many fond memories from this game but this is my favourite:
>joined a dark rp server
>first time playing dark rp
>not sure what to expect
>over 100 people in the server
>jumping around like an idiot
>random two guys come out of an alley
>"hey you *horrible pronunciation of my name* hey come here"
>i take the bait
>they trap me in this alley
>guns pointed at me
>"WALK YOU ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•"
>holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•shit.jpg
>i ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• walk
>they trap me in a larger area at the end of the alley
>two other people there
>line us up on the wall
>demand money
>they're yelling at us
>i'm not listening, i'm in the spawn menu looking for something to help me
>see a turtle
>ah yes
>spawn a turtle
>kidnapper 1 stops his sentence
>"what the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•"
>"is that a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• turtle"
>"remove that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• right now"
>i don't remove it
>"REMOVE THAT ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• TURTLE"
>i don't remove it
>"IF YOU DON'T REMOVE THAT TURTLE I'M GONNA PUT A CAP IN YO ASS"
>i don't remove it
>while they're distracted, guy next to me spawns a couch
>guy throws a couch at kidnappers
>kills them both
>we all escape, friend eachother, and start a gun/drug shop together

This game got me into PC gaming. I was around 10 years old when I saw people on youtube like Venturiantale and later VanossGaming play this. I watched people play this game for 2 years until finally I got my own laptop and after a while of figuring out how to install steam (and getting a virus in the process) I bought Garry's Mod
with a steam gift card I had asked for that Christmas. My dream had come true. I played sandbox, multiplayer servers, installed a couple mods, etc.
I was hooked for a couple months, sinking hours into the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you could do in this game. Every video game I had ever played up to this point had no freedom compared to this game. I would think about all the things I'd do in this game when I got home from school, then spend hours finding something else to do in it, falling into a rabbit hole of creativity in the process.
Slowly over time the feeling died down a bit. Like most source games, this game acted as a gateway into other games on steam. I installed TF2 because of Garry's Mod, and although I wouldn't seriously play tf2 for years after installing it, it became my most played video game of all time. I've been living in a cycle with this game for over 7 years. I'd be completely obsessed with Gmod for a month then for a couple months I'd rarely play. Then I'd be driven back to this game. Back to 500+ mods and no objective.
In my mind, this quality gives this game immortality. The sandbox which relies on people to keep building it further, unhindered by developer updates making mods obsolete or any expectation that the game has for you. This game changes constantly through modding, and the life and death of individual multiplayer servers and gamemodes, but it will never truly change. It wants nothing from you when you boot up the game. It has no qualms about your choices.
There is beauty in a game never changing. So many modern developers and customers want video games to be new and exciting, to such a degree that it becomes absolutely obnoxious. Such is the case with battlepasses and open beta titles which start out great then become so much better through constant ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• updates that nobody even recognizes the title anymore and they refuse to play the game.
Garry's Mod will never change though, it will always be the same experience you had when you played the game 7 years ago. It won't let you down because its different than it was, it expects nothing of you when you return. The only thing that does change the experience is completely optional through the workshop.
I'm very happy to see Garry's Mod getting updates and bug fixes after all these years. It truly warms my heart that undoubtedly the greatest sandbox video game ever made is still being looked after. Just don't change the identity of this game or the innate experience of total freedom that this game provides.
TLDR
If you want a brilliant sandbox which will never let you down despite the state of modern gaming, buy this masterpiece.
