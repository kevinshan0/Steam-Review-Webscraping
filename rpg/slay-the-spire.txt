EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
My boi NL convinced me this game was the best roguelike crossed deckbuilder game he'd ever played. He was right.
Posted: June 8, 2023
The problem with slay the spire is that it made all the other roguelite deckbuilders obsolete before they even came out.

imagine spending 45 minutes carefully building a deck just to get killed by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ donut

Nothing feels as good as getting a good deck synergy going. Makes you feel like an absolute genius for knowing how to read.

An example to all those stuck in Early Access.
These developers set realistic goals. Listened to feedback. Gave weekly updates. and released the game in less than a year with MAJOR improvements. They always responded to comments and made the users feel listened too.
The game is just excellent in its pollished form. Each character feels unique and each run feels unique. Endless hours of entertainment. But mostly, I'm impressed by the developers work ethics here.

Product received for free
In my opinion, this is the best roguelite deckbuilder ever made and also in contention for the best roguelite ever. The design of the game is close to perfect -- every card, relic, and enemy is in for a reason and serves a purpose, and there's almost no additions to the game that serve to just up the item count without offering interesting playstyle consequences. It's very easy to understand, and yet that betrays its considerable depth and endless replayability. It's very good!

With the accessibility mods available for this game, it is completely playable for blind gamers, like myself, who use screen readers. The game play is rich while being easy to learn which leads to hours of entertainment. This is a game I keep returning to play.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I love card games of all types. I grew up playing traditional card games like Crazy Eights, Solitaire and Uno. I later got into Bridge, Rummy and Poker until Magic the Gathering (MtG) consumed my life for years.
These days though its hard to find people to play traditional card games anymore and Magic the Gathering and other CCG's are way too expensive to keep up to date with.
A few years ago I discovered physical deck building games like Dominion, Thunderstone, Race for the Galaxy and many more. I had a ton of fun playing these, but again it is hard to get a group together on a consistent basis so I turned to the PC. Several of these games have pretty good PC versions, but they are still restricted by the fact that they are based on physical games. There are often clunky mechanics that really slow things down. That's fine when playing with friends at home, but over the Internet or alone against an AI it tends to get old pretty fast.
There have been quite a few digital card games recent years that are great, but most of them are based on card collecting and those can rival even Magic the Gathering in cost if you want to stay up to date with the best cards.
Then come Slay the Spire, A game it took me weeks of hearing people talk about before I finally gave it a chance. This little weird looking card game has somehow managed to tap into so many things I love about card games and video games that when people ask me about it I struggle to even say anything about it because there is so much I want to say.
Drawing your cards:
The reason I love card games today as much as I did as a kid is for the simple feeling you get when you are dealt your cards, you pick them up and see if you have a good hand. That rush of excitement at the possibilities of what your hand has for you never gets old, its why I got so heavily into Magic the Gathering, since apposed to games like Bridge or Rummy you get to draw new cards constantly. This is also true for deck builders and even more so with Slay the Spire than many others since you play your hand fast and don't have to worry about building your deck while you're playing it. This brings me to my second point...
Building the deck:
Slay the Spire has done a genius move by taking the deck building aspects of a deck builder away from the action of playing. So when I am in a "fight" I don't have to think for 2 minutes about which card to get like you have to do in Dominion style games. After a fight is over you are rewarded with a selection of new cards and only then do you have to make decisions about what card to pick. And that choice is always informed by how the last battle went, so you know what your deck is missing before you pick your new card. I really love building my deck as I play with it, its how I used to tinker with my MtG decks back in the day and the reason why the physical deck building games appealed so much to me. Slay the Spire has the incremental building of a deck builder, but without the constant "stop and think" style of play which slow those games down. This makes the pacing of the game much more interesting. You have an action phase, followed by a thinking phase. Rather than jumbling them both into each other.
Playing the cards:
All this would be for naught had the game not been fun to play. Thankfully the cards are interesting and have a ton of cool interactions with each other. There are many different types of decks you can build and they can often change and adapt as you play if you find that one rare card or relic you can build a whole deck around. This makes the game extremely re-playable, more so than any other deck builder I've played. While games like Dominion and Thunderstone have a lot of different card combinations for you to play I simply find myself enjoying what I can do in Slay the Spire more. It also plays very fast, it flows a bit like Heartstone in that sense, unless you have very complicated deck combinations which requires some forethought or specific play orders.
Best of both worlds:
Since Slay the Spire is a digital card game rather than a physical one it is not restricted to the "laws" that govern how a regular card game plays. This means they can do a lot of stuff that simply isn't possible or takes too long for physical games. Each fight is against one or several monsters who before your turn indicate what they are going to do over their heads, which usually is either attack, block or apply some buff/debuff. This means what you do on your turn is informed by that. If the monster attacks, you block, if it blocks or buffs itself you attack. Having this kind of AI interaction in a physical game could be possible, but would require a lot of dice rolling or boring set up between rounds. As you play the game more you start to learn how the different monsters work and develop strategies for each of them, making each game a little easier than the previous. Its not just your deck that's getting better, its your ability to play it as well.
The game also has a lot of statuses such as buffs and debuffs - kind of like how MtG works, which is one of the reasons why MtG can take forever to play, but with the game being digital all this is taken care of in the background. The digital version of Magic the Gathering handles these things for you as well, but since its rooted in a physical game it is a lot slower and more cumbersome than Slay the Spire.
Just one more turn...:
I am also a huge turn based strategy fan, Civilization being my favorite game of the genre. That genre has the ability to captivate me in a way that makes me just play on and on, one more turn at a time, even though I know I should have stopped hours ago. Slay the Spire does the same thing for me. Each game of Slay the Spire consists of 3 floors with multiple encounters with a boss at the end of each floor, if you die or win you get some experience points towards new unlocks and you can start again on a new run. It plays similarly to a Rogue Like in that way, a genre that I've always been fascinated by, but never got very deep into, but Slay the Spire got its hooks into me very hard. It took me quite the force of will to say "No" to another game so I could take the time to write this review. I can't wait until its over so I can try out the latest patch. Which reminds me...
Early Access:
The elephant in the room in my opinion is the fact that the game is in Early Access. That to me is always a HUGE red flag. There are a few games though such as Factorio, Rim World, Subnautica, Prison Architect, Oxygen Not Included and others that actually listen to their community, provide regular updates and already have a game that is worth playing as it is. Slay the Spire in my opinion joins the rank of these great games without question. The technical aspects of the game is top notch, it plays smoothly, there's a ton of content and it has received multiple significant updates over the few weeks I've played it. With a clearly defined Roadmap that promise more content in a game I feel already has enough content to justify its price 5 times over. I have no doubt that the game will be finished and even if development stopped today I would be more than satisfied with my purchase.
Finishing thoughts:
This is a game I am going to be playing for years to come and while it already has enough content to justify that today I can imagine limitless possibilities for it in the future. More game modes such as infinite, restricted cards, special relics or modifiers, new cards, more monsters, new characters, etc. I feel like this game has managed to do one of those things that you don't really see all that often. It has taken the best from many different genres, combined it in a new way and created something greater than the sum of its parts.
I think Slay the Spire is a game we will be talking about for years to come as a genre defining game. It has my full recommendation!
Posted: July 1, 2021
A while back I tried Darkest Dungeon, and I was constantly googling items and strategies, trying to figure out what does what, and I was always stressed that I was going to do the wrong thing.
Slay the Spire is the total opposite of that experience. Everything is intuitive, I have hardly googled anything to find out what it does, it just immediately makes sense. And rather than being scared to try things out, I can't wait to see what every card does. The game makes you feel like you're actually good at it, even if you're not that good at it.
Even though it's RNG based, I never found it (in my ten hours) to be really unfair. Sometimes you get a garbage hand, but maybe your next hand will work. And I even died multiple times without wishing pain on the creators of the game, and that is the best compliment I can give.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I don't have a lot of time for gaming anymore and with around 1000 games in my library I've never even played, I'm trying to cut back on buying new ones. So when a friend told me I had to play this one, I was skeptical. I do love card games and strategy - but I also have a lot of burnout from poor Early Access experiences and since my maternity leave is over and now I have to ugh, make money AND look after a baby, absolutely no spare time for gaming. So I surprised myself when I realized that three days after launching this, I'd managed to clock up 15 hours.
That pile of paperwork next to me, the unfinished laundry and my mums messages asking if I'm okay because she hasn't heard from me for a few days may be related in some way, but you can't prove anything! I was so tired last night I beat the final boss with the Ironclad for the first time, sent a screenshot to the friend who bullied me into playing the game (essential step), turned my PC off, walked to bed and fell asleep, to dream of deck building.
Despite my friend having played double my hours and generally being vastly superior at games to me, his playstyle choices have been vastly different. He prefers Silent, the poison character, whereas I prefer Ironclad, the strength deck. He'd never used the style of deck I used to get my first win (barricade, massive armor stacking, dual wield into body slam) and I played with quite a few different deck types before settling on my winning synergy. Even though there are not a massive array of cards, there is a significant amount of choice and strategy in your play, coupled with constant adjustments needing to be made as you pick up relics and rewards.
With over 9,000 reviews (no I mean literally, that's not a meme) and overwhelmingly positive, you don't need someone slow to this bandwagon to describe the mechanics of the game. What I will say is this is a fun roguelike deck-building card game that is simple to grasp, hard to master and incredibly addictive. I'd love to say it can be played in short bursts when you have 30 minutes here and there, but only if you've levelled your willpower to max and can walk away from the PC.
Highly recommended from me, even in Early Access, with hopefully even more content to come.

This game helped me teach my kid mental math. 100%. You have a set amount of energy. You need to either defend or attack and use your cards wisely. How much damage can you do this round? What did you draw that will help you this round? How much damage could you have done if you had a better hand? These are all things I had my (at the time 8yr old) son; right beside me while I gamed. He was so interested in the mechanics that he sat on my lap and learned about the game. I'm grateful; honestly math has become his favorite subject in school. He's now a 4th grader and still tries to con each new teacher into allowing the kids to play slay the spire; all on the premise of math learning. XD this kid's going places.
Thank you Slay the Spire for some of the best Core memories for my family.

Remember when you where young and you could play a single player game for hours/days/weeks without getting bored? With growing age it seemed no single player game could give me this feeling anymore. Until I got Slay the Spire. This game is a masterpiece. I got hooked instantly and could not let go anymore. It is worth every penny. Buy it!

My account says 19 hours played-- I have over 500 hours on this game on iOS.
STS is a video game. It has monsters that you have to kill, cool moves you can do, "levels" that you need to go through, you know, video gamey stuff. It even has potions. Still, I decided to look at it as something a bit more than just a video game.
I started off playing STS with zero deckbuilder experience. I struggled up till I finally managed to win a run. I eventually made it to the real final boss of the game, and I was like, yeah this is stupid difficult, do people actually win against this?
Fast forward a year later, and yeah people win against it. Not only that, but they win against it with handicaps. It starts off with one handicap. Then you get another. And another. It's like you already have the odds against you, but you stack them against you even more. And more, up to 20 different disadvantages to start off with. Yet people still win consistently at the game. How is that?
As I learned more about the cards. How they synergize. How to anticipate my opponents and make arrangements for the possibility of my meeting them, I started to understand. In this game, you're given a deck of cards. You can't control what cards you will find, nor what elites or bosses you will encounter. Never the less, through your own decision making, you can turn squalid conditions to your advantage and come out on top despite the odds.
In this way, I decided to view this as more than just a game. It's a simulation that demonstrates the power of making decisions that have thought behind them. Decisions that weigh pros and cons, that consider consequences. I learned that a bad situation, even if it is bad and will certainly end bad, does not have to be as bad as it gets. By carefully considering options, studying the situation, one can mitigate whatever negative aspects exist in any given situation. If they are also lucky, or particularly gifted, they may even reverse it into a good situation.
To me STS served as a reminder of that, and as a good demonstration of how powerful this concept is. I was able to go from a situation I really was convinced was hopeless, to being able to regularly and casually beat that same boss that I thought was impossible a year back, with at least 10-12 different handicaps on top of that. All because I changed how I think and how I made decisions.
I recommend this game to anyone. Even if you don't choose to learn life lessons from it, you still have an exceptional game to play.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I fell asleep in the middle of trying to finish just one more run and woke up with the controller still in my hand the next day. This hasn't happened to me since I was a little kid so I felt the game deserved an early review.
Fun and addictive turn based rogue lite featuring turnbased card combat as it's main gameplay mechanic. Fair RNG, Multiple characters with their own cards and playstyles, a real solid difficulty curve that rewards strategy and punishes carelessness. Though it is in early access and more content is always appreciated, the core gameplay loop is complete and very entertaining. A quick browse shows the developers update the game on a weekly basis and seem fairly responsive to community concerns and ideas. Definitely recommend investing into the game before it leaves early access and it's price increases.
It is still rough around some edges with some interface graphic bugs occassionally and one run ending bug that prevented selection with both the left mouse button and my controller but that has only happened once so far. Restarting my game fixed it for me but some report you might need a system restart. Controller support could use SteamAPI intergration, if you are like me you will need to fiddle with your Pro controller in the game setting and get used to wrong Xbox positioned icons being displayed for your face buttons. The developers seem aware of the issues and hassles and are looking into it.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TL;DR Sum-up
Slay the Spire has players fighting with cards through a semi-randomly generated dungeon, and build their character and deck with random drops. Slay the Spire has players struggling, screaming, raging, then asking for more, because that’s how fun Slay the Spire is.
Based on challenging and enjoyable mechanics, which palliate for its lack of artistic polish and uneven pacing, its formula is meant for challenge seekers, to which I recommend it even at its current price. Newcomers to either card battle games or rogelike/lites might want to wait for a discount.
TL;DR Sheet
In general
In one sentence:	Build a deck, love your deck, lose your deck, rinse and repeat.
Genre:	Yu-Gi-Oh gone RoguePlaytime:	10 to XXX hours, then draw a card
Get it for:	A refreshing take on card games, your daily dose of frustration, your git gud experience of this year.
Dont get it if:	You don’t like restarting from zero, facing long odds
Technically
Visuals, sound, tech:	6/10 - appropriate, bonfire screens need much more work
Art direction, music, acting	6,5/10 - Appropriate, lacks character and immersion.
General experience, gameplay:	8/10 - Highly replayable, new experience every playthrough, but somehow unevenly paced.
General rating, worth the price?	7.5/10 - Unique in its category, great potential, worth the price if you’re into Rogue gameplay, grab on sales if you’re new to the genre.
The good, the bad, the meh
The good
+ Nice mechanics
+ Fresh genre combination
+ The occasional, very rewarding power trip
+ The occasional tense confrontation
The Meh
= Still a lot to be done with the art
= Forgettable/Annoying audio
= Could use more enemies types and playable characters
= No bestiary yet
= Inherent unfairness of some runs
= First 2 to 3 combats are always boring as hell
The bad
- Animations take way too long
- The bonfire screens
Full Review
Slay The Spire has players ascend a tower made of 50 randomly generated floor, where each floor becomes the setting for a confrontation, a strategic choice (gain X, lose Y), a bonus or a mercantile transaction. Combats are fought by carefully picking cards which will trigger various offensive, defensive and strategic effects. Along the way, players will build their character thanks to random card, gold, and bonus drops, in hope of finally reaching the top and, eventually, restart from the bottom and/or compete in a daily run event. Three different playable characters are available, each with their own set of cards and unique gameplay.
The strength of the title is undoubtedly its combat and deck building mechanics, where players will have to improvise and make sweet, sweet lemonade of of runs that sometimes feel like the ultimate lemon storm; card and bonuses drops obtained after clearing a floor are random, and if a build will certainly evolve throughout a given run, how it will evolve is down to luck and very strategic choices.
There is something to be said about a heavy reliance on RNG. The game can at times feel frustratingly random in its difficulty (I almost beat it during my first run, then struggled for the next 8 hours). That said, card games are random by nature, and this formula is meant to appeal to players who enjoy facing strong and uncertain odds. To somewhat balance this built-in unfairness, though, the developers have implemented a forced flush mechanic, where unplayed cards automatically go to a flush pile after ending a turn. This system helps knowing what card will come next and allows nice little tricks such as digging in the flush pile for that one card that might very well change the issue of the battle.
If the combat and gameplay of Slay the Spire are a lot of fun, some other aspects could benefit from a lot more polish. The art is sometimes painful to watch (bonfire screens in particular need a lot more work) and I personally found the music and sound effect lacking impact. Too standard and repetitive to be immersive, no dynamic soundtrack, very few sound effects for the variety of cards provided, and generally forgettable themes; I do play on mute. That said, the game still being in early access, there is still hope for improvement and in any case, the art doesn’t matter that much once a combat has started.
Technically, the only real downside of the game is its animations. With no variety whatsoever, they are also slow enough (even on their fastest setting) to account for a good 30% of a turn’s time depending on how fast players take their decisions. With nothing to justify this length and no skip option, they increase the duration of single runs and decrease the fun/time ratio. Added to the general boredom of the first 2 or 3 fights, and a title that could be much more nervous currently suffers for an unequal pace that can become uncomfortable.
Verdict
Slay the Spire is based on challenging and enjoyable mechanics, which palliate for its lack of artistic polish and uneven pacing. Its fresh, appealing formula is meant for challenge seekers, to which I recommend it even at its current price. Newcomers to either card battle games or rogelike/lites might want to wait for a discount.

There is just no cure for this addiction of building the perfect deck and then die because of a misstep.

Posted: January 23, 2019
This is way more replayable than it seems like it would be.
Posted: December 20, 2019
Nothing's perfect.
But Slay the Spire is close enough to spit.
Slay the Spire is a deckbuilding roguelike. You start the game with a very simple 12 card deck, gather cards as you climb up and fight battles/go through events/rest at campfires/shop at... shops, and then hopefully the deck grows into something cohesive enough to challenge the bosses of the Spire. Mechanically, it's quite simple - deal enough damage to reduce the enemy's health to zero, use Defend cards to protect against incoming attacks, and your deck reshuffles when you go through the whole thing.
However, the game uses this mechanical simplicity as a rock-solid foundation to build complexity and depth. Cards like "Draw a card. Discard a card." can become the absolute foundation of a deck, while a card like "Deal 32 damage" can be an absolute dead draw... depending on your other card picks. Relics, passive bonuses to your character, add another layer to consider. You have a relic that lets you keep drawing cards when you empty your hand - should you focus on 0-cost cards and eliminate your higher cost ones, when removing cards from your deck is a rare and expensive service?
The game's art style is unique, and while it may not appeal to everyone, it's at least refreshing and fun. It's a funny game without leaning too hard into humor, it's a cute game without leaning into weeb cuteness, overall everything is at the least well-made.
If you enjoy card games, if you enjoy roguelikes, ABSOLUTELY PICK THIS UP.

"Just one more run"
Posted: June 1, 2021
The crown of cardgames, a healthy addiction. One of the very best games ever!
My favourite game as of 2021!
Normally I tell a bit about the story, however in this game it's kind of a mystery. During the game you receive bits of clues what's going on, but this is open for interpretation and imagination. I wouldn't want to spoil that experience. All I can say is that your character must climb the spire!
Mechanics
Every run starts with five strike cards, five defend cards, and two special cards specific for your character. You also get one start relic, tailored for your class.
After every battle you can choose one of three cards. There are three degrees of rarities that can drop: common, uncommon and rare. All cards have of itself more power than the starting cards, and so it's imperative to add new cards, remove bad cards, and preferably find some powerful synergy.
There are three types of cards:
- attack cards
- power cards; these buff your character, giving a bonus during this battle. The power card is consumed upon use, while other cards typically are discarded.
- skill cards; these can be many things, like defend, draw- or create cards. Basically everything that's not an attack or a power.
Cards can drop in upgraded form, or can be upgraded at campfires, random events, or during a battle.
Throughout the spire there are also elite monsters, which give a greater chance of high quality cards, but more importantly they give a relic. Relics provide powerful bonuses all the time, a permanent power, sort of. They can dictate what the best strategy will be, or what strategy absolutely will not work. Like cards, relics also come in three rarities, and the rare relics are very very powerful! You typically obtain around five rare relics each run.
Besides monsters and elite monsters there are also vendors, campfires and random events. You can choose your own route, selecting which types of events you prefer. For me, I always choose a greedy route with the most elites (and often pay the price for my gluttony!).
Every 16th level is a boss, which can be seen beforehand, so you can prepare your deck.
If you climb all the way to the top, you unlock a new ascension level. Each ascension level makes the game progressively harder. There are twenty ascension levels. Aside this, your character also receives experience. This unlocks powerful new cards and relics.
Four protagonists
Ironclad
The Ironclad is a warrior with a two-handed sword. Her key features are:
- big attacks
- exhausting cards from her hand (exhaust is remove card from deck this battle)
- self damage for several benefits
She starts with a relic that heals her after each battle, making her the easiest to start with, because healing is not widely available.
The Silent
The Silent is a thief or a rogue with a dagger. Her key features are:
- creating shivs in large numbers; zero cost attacks which can be boosted greatly!
- poison; a damage-over-time that does damage at the start of your opponent's turn.
- discarding cards (which enables other cards)
The Silent deals a lot of damage, but has very limited ability to heal. Her starting relic draws two extra cards on her first turn, making it easier to find powerful combo's.
The Defect
The Defect is a robot. It's key features are:
- orbs; orbs are changed to provide damage, armour or energy. They can be triggered by cards or charging orbs when you have no empty slots, for an increased effect. Triggering consumes the orb.
- power cards; it has power cards that boosts or create other power cards.
Since many cards of The Defect work indirectly, it is very easy to die. It's very tempting to choose the wrong cards early in the spire, because you have memories of shining successes in previous runs, however lack the support for playing said card. It starting relic gives one lightning orb.
The Watcher
Added last year, The Watcher is a monk-like class. She is generally regarded as slightly easier than the other three. Her key features are:
- stances; stances can give an immense bonus to damage, while the calm stance gives energy upon leaving the stance.
- 'retain' trait on certain cards, meaning they don't discard at the end of the turn.
These two features scream combo! Her starting relic generates a card each turn that creates 1 energy and can be retained. Besides this she has cards with:
- scry; look at x cards from the top of your draw pile, and either return or discard them.
Combo combo combo!!!
The Spire beckons!
I find it very fulfilling to play this game, although I loose most of my climbs, it's always very tempting to do another run. The average winrate of the best players is around 60%, so it's no shame to fail.
I find passive effects really charming, so I have played mostly The Defect. And failed a lot, o boy! Even when you play 'bad', choosing a questionable strategy, sometimes you just get lucky. The other side of that coin is that some climbs are doomed to fail. Such is The Spire, and we accept this fact.
Generally when you reach ascension 20, you ought to have a good understanding of the game. Along the way we all make the same mistakes:
- super-multi-attacking a character with thorns
- omitting healing because of preferring upgrading cards
- closing paths with elites while your deck is utter garbage
- choosing only attack cards, or only defense cards.
I generally choose too many cards because I like cards!!
Every run brings something new. I could literally play this all day. It feels a bit like many big free-to-play games can make you feel, but without the terrible business models. This is one of the best games ever made, period!
97/100
For me, it's almost perfect. But I can think of one thing that could be improved, and it's a very personal thing. When selecting a next encounter, you have to give a very short mouseclick. Due to my illness I am not always able to do that. Frustrating! Oh, and for having a speedrun achievement, which is impossible for some people.

Posted: July 1, 2022
This review is for casual to mid-range gamers, because there are plenty of reviews from the competitive crowd that go into much more intense detail than I am capable of doing.
I'll keep this short, because in the end all I'm doing is throwing my hat in the ring with 97% of other Slay the Spire players in saying this game is 100% worth your money. So I'll address the one thing I haven't seen any other reviews talking about.
The difficulty/complexity curve in Slay the Spire is about as close to perfect as it gets. Each of the four characters plays fundamentally differently, and each has multiple viable paths for building a deck. As you start learning the game, the first thing you'll be doing is unlocking additional cards and relics for each character, allowing those cards and relics to show up in future runs. These unlocks slowly ramp up the complexity of the game by providing the player with more options and hinting at new deck archetypes to shoot for in future runs.
By the time you've gotten all five unlocks on a character, you've likely won a run or two. Winning your first run unlocks the first of twenty Ascension levels for that character, each of which progressively makes runs on that character a bit more difficult in different ways, which are clearly noted in the character select UI.
I haven't progressed too far into Ascension, as I'm still working on a final couple of unlocks, but even as a gamer who prefers to play games for story over mechanics, I am thoroughly impressed by how smoothly Slay the Spire eased me into the game. This is not to say the game is not difficult--it is unforgiving, moderately luck-based, and occasionally infuriating--but the developers have done a splendid job of crafting a new player onboarding ramp that makes it honestly difficult not to learn the basics of how the game works. I've never seen such a smooth onboarding for such a difficult game, and it makes the experience far more welcoming than it has any right to be, given how gleefully the RNG will royally screw you over at times.
So for casual to mid-range gamers wondering if Slay the Spire is too hardcore for them--well, it probably is, but it'll do a damn fine job of getting you to a point where, for at least a little while...for a few runs every now and again...you can be hardcore too. I highly recommend it.

I played this the first time to scratch my Hearthstone itch. My Slay the Spire itch is now way worse than my Hearthstone itch ever was. 10/10.

First deck builder game for me.
218 hours later, finally add it to my "perfect games" list.
Would Slay the Spire again...

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is ABSOLUTELY amazing! I'm generally not a fan of card-based games, but there's something about Slay the
Spire that I can't let go...The cards and relics have very unique synergies, but it's also not overly convoluted! The fact that the deck system is dynamic keeps me coming back for more runs! The rush of getting that one card for your deck, or getting another card to change your mental process and possibly have you think twice about your build...As other reviews before me have said, it is a great example of a game that is easy to pick up, but hard to master. The artwork is amazing and I adore the soundtrack!
Pros-
Wonderful artwork
Wonderful soundtrack
Currently two characters with very different play styles
Wide variety of cards between the two characters, offering many deck variations
Relics offer multitudes of playstyles and adds variety to runs
Dungeons offer many different and unique paths, including normal fights, elite fights, merchant shops, and DnD-styled, story-like encounters with possibilities of great rewards...or your own demise
Cons (if you even call these cons)-
Still Early Access (as of this review) but for an Early Access game...you wouldn't think it was
Yearning for more cards
Yearning for more relics
Yearning for the third character
Wouldn't mind seeing an extra tower or two in a run (currently only 51 floors)
Conclusion: Seriously, this game is outstanding! I cannot wait to see what else MegaCrit decides to shell out with future updates and up to its full release! For an Early Access game, it seriously feels like it's a full title as it is and I cannot stop thinking about it! Well worth the $16 (again, as of this review and all throughout Early Access) and will provide you with hours upon hours of entertainment! Thank you, MegaCrit, for providing an excellent game!

If you enjoy your life or have someone you enjoy spending time with—say, a romantic partner who has deluded themselves into seeing past the myriad flaws that should disqualify you from the dating pool, or, God forbid, a spouse or child who depends on you to do the bare minimum to keep your nuclear family intact, to engage with them as the miracles of existence they are—this is not the game for you.
Stop. Look around you: you’re building something beautiful, difficult, indelible. That wish list notification that the little fantastical card game all your friends have sunk 1,500 hours into is 66% off is not your friend.
Is the game great? Sure! Fun even! Advanced! Intricate! At times brilliant! Thrilling! But make no mistake—you will lose everything you love, and the aptly named Time Eater will not be there at the end of Act III to pick up the pieces of your life. No, the Time Eater will smugly laugh at your miserable existence, your lack of self-control, your inability to do basic arithmetic, and when the Spire wears thin, when the perfect little strategy you devised wide awake in bed as your loved ones slept is foiled for the thousandth time by a bad reshuffle that was surely algorithmically rigged, you will be the one slain, friend. You idiot. You degenerate. You poor, unsuspecting sucker.
Find another way to escape your problems. Mow the lawn. Take up embroidery. Join a bowling team. Catalogue birds. Start a hot sauce collection. Pick your porn addiction back up. Shoot a basketball at the neighbor’s hoop until their kids come out and threaten to kick your ass. Anything is better than going down this path, champ. You can’t return from it.

Its good its fun and its mathematically unfair so you need some luck and a lot of skill.
If you like nasty rogue-likes where you lose 90% of the time and become god 10% this is for you.

So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island. I am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future. So just try this. Even my 10 year old son loves it. I just recorded The Slaying for him xD

So, here I am quarantined in one of the quarantine hotels in shanghai with only my mac book pro(2014). This game runs great on my dated mac with high setting, and helped me get through the 14 day quarantine, highly recommended.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I enjoy this game quite a bit................. Wanted to let you guys know..... Someone is stealing your game and saying they developed it under a reskinning and pixelated version..... But I could easily tell its your game.... The Game on Steam is "Royal Booty Quest" Alot of people are calling them out on it.
Posted: December 1, 2019
Slay the Spire is somehow the apotheosis of the genre where it inspired many copies. Before I bought it, I figured it probably wasn't much different/better than Monster Slayers, Guild of Dungeoneers, or various other card battle games, right?
Wrong. Somehow, StS manages a perfect blend of roguelike randomness and predictability, to the point where when I die, I rarely feel like it was completely unfair. I should have had more block in my deck, needed to kill that enemy faster, should have saved some potions for the boss, shouldn't have been so stingy with potions earlier so I'd have more HP now, etc. The variety of cards, enemies that all tell you what they plan to do, vast plethora of interesting relics, random adventures, and of course the slowly unfolding underlying frametale, all combine into something that's every bit as compelling as everyone was saying.
Very strong recommendation for anyone with any sort of interest in the genre.
EDIT: Years on, I still go back to this game occasionally to do a few runs. It's just that good.
Posted: August 24, 2023
Just one more run

Like hearthstone but you won't spend thousands of dollars
Posted: January 14, 2021
Do you believe in the heart of the cards?
I sure do. There's no other game that still, after over 200 hours, makes me get out of the chair and fistpump wildly cos I drew exactly the right card I needed to defeat the final boss.
This game is perfect - just the right balance of roguelike misery where you lose 6 times in a row to the first stage boss, only to have 2 godlike runs in a row where you crush everything, and then one run where you just manage to fly by the seat of your pants to victory with 1hp left.
10/10 favourite game would buy again
Posted: November 17, 2020
This is one of the best games I have ever played. It is a masterpiece of design and has remained truly fun and engaging for over 2,500 hours. The strategy is so deep that I still feel like I learn new things every time I play. Incredible.

Hearthstone dungeon runs, but far better.
Also mobile version please.
Please.
I NEED IT
EDIT: Also thanks dev's for the constant updates, I swear this game is worth way more than it is priced at.

2000 hours later... I could have learned an instrument, I could have read my entire library of books, I could have finished half of my steam library... But nope. i dont regret anything. The best deck building game ive played. Even after 2000 hours, I still find new strategies and synergy with the cards.
My fried tried it once and refuse to buy it because he knows he'll probably fail college.

Games like this ought to come with a Surgeon General’s warning.
They go down like a Long Island iced tea. Things seem ok at first, but before you know it you can find yourself in big trouble. I realized this only after 30 hours of my life suddenly vanished…poof in the blink of an eye.
Later I took another little peek inside, and there went 20 more hours. Where did it all go? It’s still kind of hazy.
On its surface this game is so simple. You can jump right in and grasp the fundamentals in about 30 seconds. But easy to learn, hard to master, as they say. Not that I ever came anywhere close to mastering it, of course; although you can blame at least part of that on the unpredictability inherent to this genre.
If you haven’t played one of these things before, basically what you’re doing is navigating a series of turn-based battles using a set of abilities–attacks, blocks, special powers, etc.–that you assemble along the way like a deck of cards. Every turn, you draw a certain number of cards and use them to deal damage and defend yourself. The main challenge is in building an effective deck on the fly based on which cards you happen to find.
Flexibility is probably your best friend there. While you can buy a few extra goodies from the shops you visit, mostly your’re stuck with whatever they give you in the battles and other random encounters and you just have to make the best of it.
You may find yourself gravitating toward one sort of deck, but sometimes you just don’t get the right cards and like it or not you’re forced to change your plans. Problem is, doing that requires a pretty broad understanding of the cards and how they work together: which ones are key to build around, which ones are better early vs. later in the run, etc. At first you don’t really have any idea what most of them do, so you end up having to learn a lot of it by trial and error.
If you want to sound fancy you can tell people you’re building a heuristic, but it mostly comes down to observing what works and what doesn’t. As you play you start to get a sense for how happy you usually are when particular cards turn up, and that tends to be a good rule of thumb. Or, you know, just go and read someone else’s guide and give yourself a head start.
Either way, you’ve got a lot of decisions to make, starting with which route to take through each of the three main levels. Do I need more cards? That means I need to steer toward more battles. But then I risk taking more damage. How’s my health doing? Do I fight that boss up ahead and maybe take a big hit in exchange for another magic item? I can heal at that campfire, but that means I don’t get to upgrade another card. So how’s my deck coming along? Do I really need to upgrade certain cards or can I get by with what I have? Do I need to thin out my deck more? Should I risk a random encounter for that, not knowing what I might get?
The whole game is one long balancing act like that, where you’re constantly weighing what you have against what you need and what the risks are. Meanwhile, since there’s no reloading from earlier saves, one wrong move can doom all of your efforts; but I guess that’s the nature of these sorts of games.
Now if this is starting to sound a little intimidating, don’t worry: it’s not really that bad. At the basic level you just need to be relatively sensible about your choices and after a few tries that’ll be good enough to get you through the fake ending.
You can do all of this with four different characters, and each one has a distinctive style that creates a totally different experience, which was quite an accomplishment. There are some cards and items to unlock for each character, but for the most part it’s not a grindy game. The replay value really does come from engaging naturally with the challenges available.
Beyond the fake ending I mentioned, there’s also a real ending, and then 20 more difficulty levels that grow more and more insane. So there’s practically endless content here if you want it, although the average player is probably going to tap out long before hitting the ceiling.
One issue is that healing opportunities are few and far between, so even though it feels pretty fast-paced you do have to play with an eye toward long-term survival. The odds say that sooner or later you’re going to draw a bad hand, which can wreck everything if it comes at the wrong time. That tends to skew you toward certain strategies to smooth over catastrophic damage spikes, either by stacking armor across turns or by accelerating card draw. Also, energy (i.e., more actions per turn) relics are extremely powerful, and can make or break a whole run all by themselves. These sorts of things can place a practical limit on the amount of variety unless you really know what you’re doing.
Plus, I think some of the mechanics would be pretty confusing if you’re not already familiar with how these card games work. I mean, it goes against every video game instinct to turn down a reward, yet that’s often what you have to do to keep your deck small enough to be effective. Same thing with deliberately exhausting (that is, permanently discarding) cards, or removing cards from your deck altogether. It’s not necessarily clear why you’d want to do things like this, and you’re pretty much left to figure it out by yourself. That’s asking a lot of a newer player.
The more the difficulty ramps up, the more optimized and regimented your approach needs to be, and thus the more un-fun it probably becomes unless you’re someone who really thrives on getting deep into the weeds and pondering every little nuance of this system. For most of us, after you’ve seen the same encounters a hundred times it starts to wear a little thin.
Still, you’re dealing with high-grade, weaponized material here, and even at a low level it offers dozens of hours of entertainment.
Just writing this is making me itchy to start another run.
“Come on, just a little taste…”
Ok, that’s enough. Gotta go uninstall this right now before I end up losing my job.

Smarter people than me have extolled the virtues of Slay the Spire, so I'll simply say that after 20+ years of gaming, Slay the Spire has sneaked its way in to my list of All Time Favorite Games. When in doubt about what to play, StS is always a good choice. So yes, I would recommend this game to other players.
Posted: December 13, 2018
tl;dr -> This is one of those games where I will get absolutely destroyed by RNG just as I completed a fantastic deck, sigh, and say, "time to try again.” Until 3am. 11/10 would card-craft again.
Normally, I am very hesitant to review games that are still in early access, but Slay the Spire is so much fun and the dev team has been solid in updates that I didn’t mind making an exception.
Disclosure: I LOVE deck-building - I own 3 versions of Dominion, 4 different DC Comics Deck-Building Games, Legendary (Marvel), and the 2-player variant of Ascension. Those are all deck-building tabletop card games. I also played Magic the Gathering (physical, never digital) extensively for two years, and Hearthstone for 3-4.
If you like deck-building, rogue-likes, dungeon crawling, being at the mercy of RNGesus, and dying frequently, then you will enjoy this game. Did I mention dying? You’ll be doing a lot of that.
The aesthetics are good - I like the art style and detail in the character/monster models, cards, and relics (loot that gives bonuses). The animations are very basic - your character does not actually move and attack, but the sound effects are decent enough. The music is appropriate for the grim setting of dungeon crawling, however, I muted all sound within a few hours of playing in favor of my own playlist. I made a half-joke with my friend that because I care about deck-building in this game more than anything else, I would have preferred if there were no animations at all so I could play even faster (I play on the “fast mode” setting). There is no voice-acting or narration.
The game can be played entirely with a mouse, but you can also use the keyboard to select cards quickly (good for if you are trying to speedrun). The learning curve is slight to moderate depending on your experience with deck-builders - understanding how to make your deck more efficient (ex: pruning useless cards, focusing on synergy, and skipping rewards you don’t need) will increase your chances of success tremendously. I recommend trying the daily climbs until you win because it will teach you combos (the map and rewards - or dungeon “seed” - stay the same, so you can learn from your mistakes) and overall card-crafting meta. The card descriptions are helpful, and you can always hover over debuff/buff icons for an explanation of each.
There are three characters to choose from, each with a different set of “core” cards and unique playstyles. There are also neutral cards that are available across all classes. Card rarity consists of common (gray), uncommon (blue), and rare (yellow). Like most deck-builders, you will start off with a deck of basic cards. You obtain cards after defeating monsters, from certain events, and by purchasing them at the store. Attack cards deal damage, skills apply effects (including damage), and powers apply buffs and disappear from your deck until the battle is over. The "“exhaust” attribute on certain cards means they are put into a separate discard pile that you cannot interact with unless you have a card (Exhume) that returns them to active play.
After you select a character, the map for the first dungeon (there are 3 + 1 secret) will be shown. From here, you can select a starting point - I strongly suggest you trace each route (there are forks) to find your optimal path. Locations include monsters (these make up most of the route), ? events (can also be stores or battles), elite monsters, campfires (rest or upgrade a card) and stores. The end of each level is a boss fight (you fight 1 of 3 chosen at random), and each location is considered a floor - this is important to remember because after 150+ hours of playing I finally realized that a relic called The Maw (gives 15 gold for every floor you climb until the first time you spend gold at the store) activates on “floors” and not “levels,” making it significantly more useful.
During combat, you use Action Points (AP) to play cards. All characters start with 3 AP, but there are relics and cards that increase that pool. Every card is upgradeable, and some of them involve a reduction in AP cost (or cost 0 AP to begin with). Battles are turn-based, so you will go through your actions first, then the enemy party will go next (regardless of their size). There is an icon above each enemy showing what they intend to do on their turn - this can range from attacking, buffing themselves, debuffing you, and other special things. At the end of your turn, all unused cards are discarded; when you have no cards left in your deck, you reshuffle. There is a relic that allows you to retain your hand across turns, and there is also a card that lets you hold one card (stackable).
Experimenting with card combos is my favorite element in Slay the Spire. There is even a relic that allows access to cards from other classes, making the possibilities seem limitless. I saw a build where the player had 2 Flash of Steels (a 0-cost attack that deals 3 damage and allows you to draw one card} and was able - through the grace of RNGesus - to trim his deck down to just those two. This resulted in what is known as an infinite turn because he would keep drawing another Flash of Steel, and could only be countered by one boss that ends your turn whenever you play your 12th card (across all rounds). A poison-focused deck while playing as The Silent. Poison is a debuff that does x damage at the end of every turn and reduces by 1; if you can keep the poison counter high enough, then the enemy will stay in that state until it dies (or until it kills you). After playing for 160+ hours, I am still finding new card synergies. The dev team has also done a fantastic job listening to player feedback, regularly implementing bug fixes and game balances (for example, The Ironclad’s Burning Blood used to heal 10hp - now, you need to upgrade the relic to recover that much.
Overall, Slay the Spire is easily the best deck-building videogame I have ever played, and one of the top rogue-likes as well. At first, I was worried that I would get bored of the game because there were only 3 characters, however, Slay the Spire still finds ways to surprise me. Considering it is still in early access, I am perfectly comfortable recommending this title as a complete game even if the dev team suddenly decided to abandon development. If you have ANY interest in deck-building or rogue-likes, then I wholeheartedly implore you to try this game. You will not be disappointed. You will, however, die often. Seriously.
Normally I try not to mention price because everyone’s perception is different, but the $17.99 CAD is a steal, and I would gladly pay triple that for the experiences I received in return. This is the way early access should be used.
ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It's gloriously akin to a fantasy RPG version of FTL, but purely turn based. Both combat and character progression are also far more strategic. Sounds like a dream? Dreamy it is!
Despite being early access it comes with none of the flaws. It's totally polished, doesn't feel unfinished, has loads of content and it's super replayable.
Thanks to the devs for making a really amazing game, and moreover, doing it right! Looking forward to the updates :)
Posted: November 22, 2018
Slay the Spire has provided an unbelievable amount of entertainment. Even though it's in Early Access, it's easy to lose hundreds of hours playing it. Modding can expand that number significantly, as well.
The game is a run-based, deck-building rogue-lite. You select from one of three classes that begin with a starting deck of 10-12 cards. As you progress through the map, you choose which rooms to visit, attempting to climb up 50 floors to reach the final act. Each room can contain shops, events, combats, or campfires, where you can choose to rest and restore HP or upgrade a card. Winning a combat will give you three cards to choose from to add to your deck (or you can skip the rewards), and elite enemies will also provide a relic, which offer a variety of passive bonuses.
The developers have continued to support the game with quality content. The mechanics are simple to learn, but provide immense depth and strategic possibilities, both in combat and deck-building. The devs have been responsive and communicative, with updates and patches being delivered regularly. Overall, the game is tremendously fun and highly recommended.

There are three key reasons why this is the greatest card game ever made;
1. Novelty. Every run feels different, exciting, new. Whether its just trying a card you've never included in your deck, facing a new enemy, or testing a new strategy. This game feels fresher with every attempt, and every victory leaves the player itching to win again.
2. Transparency. The mechanics of the game are fairly simple and intuitive. You'll always know exactly how much damage the enemies are dealing to you, exactly what purpose an item serves, and exactly why you lost a run. Slay the Spire communicates so much to the player so effectively.
3. Depth. The mechanics behind this game, while simple in and of themselves, unfold into a beautiful tapestry as you dive deeper into them. Interactions between temporary buffs and artifacts, cards playing into one another in fascinating ways, synergies emerging between two unrelated items. Genuinely, 1000 hours into this, I am still learning, still growing as a player, and still loving this game more and more.
Rest assured, this game is worth every penny. Put on a show, and play a run or two. Download a mod, and play with a friend or three. Beat it, lose at it, experiment and toy with it; the fun of Slay the Spire is simple, logical, and nearly, if not truly infinite.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Edit: Thanks for the comments everyone! I very much appreciate all of you. Although, to be clear, I have moved on to other games, so I will not be responding to everyone individually. Thanks again.
Ever play the IRL card game Dominion? Well Slay the Spire is the video game analog. And that's a great thing. For those not in the know - this is a card game with the core mechanic of hand-management. What this means is that strategy is largely focused on how many cards you keep in your deck. For instance you may prune your deck to have few cards, but all of them are heavy hitters. Another strategy may be to have a ton of cards and you focus on increasing the number of turns you are taking (energy). It's cool.
The only thing you really need to know is that while this has a 'dungeon crawling' skin - it is a card game, period. There is not really any dungeon crawling here as far as I am concerned. This is fine, but again you should know.
Pros:
+This is the digital version of Dominion the IRL card game.
+Very balanced and fun; if you are good at hand-management I would even dare to say this game is easy.
+Unlockables are great.
Cons:
-Eh, I'd say that the 'roguelite' deck management game market here on Steam is becoming quite crowded - and while Slay the Spire is cool - so are the others. I guess what I am saying is that unless you've exhausted the other ones in your library, you may want to think twice before getting yet another one.
Yeah, Slay the Spire is great addicting fun.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Well-balanced, fast-paced, fun, and addictive, Slay the Spire is everything you want from a rogue-like with card-based fights... but not more, mostly due to how little content the Early Access version has.
What it has, however, is really, really good. You start by choosing a character class (two available for now, and they play significantly differently). The character then traverses a dungeon, picking up new cards for their action deck after each challenge, draft-style (i.e. you get offered three and choose one). Additional modifiers are present in the form of relics, that give you more bonuses, sometimes very powerful.
(It should be noted that the good feeling this game achieves is partially due to the lack of bad/mediocre relics. Getting a relic is always a noticeable boon, which encourages more play and further exploration.)
Each of the two classes has their own selection of cards with a bunch of different synergies. The strategy you want to tailor your deck towards, therefore, depends on which early relics and legendary cards you get. That makes each run different enough.
Generally, the game is more on the fun/random side than a serious tactical brain-teased (compared to very similar games like, say, the little-known Card Quest, in which every battle is a tough challenge). That's not a downside though, because the difficulty curve is just on point to make your victories satisfying and your failures, not too disappointing.
And yes, sometimes you will die to unavoidable RNG. Such is the nature of roguelikes.
I rarely buy and play Early Acces games, but this one is already worth the price tag. Can't wait to see more content added!

Slay the Spire
This game is amazing, but leaves you so damn empty once you beat it.
Gameplay
Slay the spire mixes rogue-like and card building in a way that just seems so natural. The game consists of the player choosing from one out of 2 (final product will be 3) characters. Each character starts with a unique "relic" and some basic cards. For the first run you are forced to choose "The Ironclad" as your character. As you go through the spire you gain more cards and relics in order to reach the end.
Relics are a large part of the gameplay which can make astronomical differences in terms of how your playstyle comes into fruition. Ironclad starts out with a relic that heals him 6 HP after each combat while the other available character "The Silent" start out with a relic that allows two extra cards to be drawn at the start of combat. As a player advances they will gain more relics through defeating elite enemies, chests, the merchant, events, and more. There are a total of 115 relics in the game which are truly the definition of a game changer in terms of items.
Cards are at the heart of this game. With each character you start of with the most basic of attacks and blocks. The game revolves around attacking, blocking, and status effects. Cards can give you block to negate a set amount of damage until your next turn, attack for a set amount of damage to single or multiple enemies, inflict status effects, and more. Cards can also trigger special properties like constantly gaining strength to attack or block to defend with. Every card in the game can be improved once. Cards are gained through completing combat, the merchant, events, and more. There are currently 3 variations of cards. The ones exclusive to Ironclad, the ones exclusive to Silent, and the gray ones which both character can use.
The mixture of variety in cards and relics obtained every run along with randomly generated levels really makes each run a different and unique experience. It allows players to experiment, test their luck, and strategize with playstyles. The game currently has three acts with a total of nine possible bosses the player can face. One of the three respective bosses for an act will appear during each run for each act. It can be very satisfying to battle up the spire to get to the end but the moment when the end is reached is just so... empty. It feels like it shouldn't be over, like there should still be more to fight, more enemies to put your long built up deck against. The feel of accomplishment is overtaken by the emptiness of just ending it but wanting to continue.
Graphics/Sounds
The graphics are unique, they seem synonymous with the gameplay. They complement each other and show the effort in making this game unique. To stand out and rise above the rest as something that is a visual pleasure.
The music gives a sense of adventure and helps set the mood for trying to slay the spire.
Pros/Cons
Pros
+ Unique Graphics and good music to match with gameplay
+ Large amount of replayability
+ Good variety in relics and cards
+ Good balance for gameplay
Cons
- Only 3 Acts to beat before forced reset
Personal Thoughts
When I started slay the spire I almost beat it in one run. I had cards to boost my strength to enormous amounts and the ability to siphon health effectively. I was so close, and then my deck just didn’t draw what I needed. So then I tried to play The Silent and didn’t get nearly as close. Then back to Ironclad and so on each time experimenting with cards and relics to find better strategies to go with the relics I obtained. It’s a game that can be fun and it does not require constant attention. You could be writing a report (or a review) and be constantly checking back in to do your turn or an event and go back to working. It doesn’t take away from the fun or enjoyment and it’s easy to just hop in and have fun.
I am however disappointed that after beating the game it was like a brick wall. I ran straight into it and just stopped, I had to restart because there was nothing beyond. If a person succeeded in beating the game in the first run I don’t think they would be able to fully enjoy this game because it just kind of cuts you off there. Then what was the challenge? There was no need to change anything because it all worked the first time.
TL:DR
Slay the Spire is a truly enjoyable mix of rogue-like and card games. It blends naturally with graphics, gameplay, and music. There are currently 2 (out of a planned 3) characters to choose from each time you try with unique cards exclusive to each. Each run has different paths, events, enemies, bosses, and opportunities in order to keep the game fresh and fun. Overall Slay the Spire is a great game to play that truly feels unique .

Addicting AF, but not in a "I'm ashamed of my addiction" kinda way, more like "I play a couple rounds every week and look forward to it" kind way. Great game

i mostly play it on mobile cuz 5 hours pass in the blink of an eye with this one and it helps keep you occupied when you're on a long train ride or if you're stuck in a loop of hating yourself

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
They are adding endless mode. I'll be quitting my job soon.

This game on no volume, and a podcast running in the background, and you *too* could sleep your way to over 1,000 hours played.

TLDR:
Slay the Spire is an amazingly fun card roguelike with high amount of replayability via deck combos, daily run modifiers, and praying to RNG gods to fulfill certain achievements.
GENRE:
Roguelike card game (deck builder)
GAMEPLAY:
You start a run by choosing one of four characters to play. You build a deck with cards unique to each hero's pool of available cards and progressively defeat monsters/elite monsters/boss monsters moving from one act to the next. Along the way, you can stop by shops to buy cards/relics/potions or visit question marks for random encounters. Upon death (or defeating the final boss), your run ends and you carry over newly obtained cards into your overall card database. Then, you can do it all again from scratch.
GRAPHICS:
Simple, hand-drawn artstyle. Not graphically intensive; art fitting the feeling of climbing through a tower filled with enemies.
STORY:
There is no real "story" beside the fact that you play as some lost wanderer who wants to conquer this tower and discover what lies at the top (again and again...)
STRENGTHS:
•The game is easy to pick up and put down whenever you have a small period of time for a run.
•Slay the Spire is highly replayable as no two runs are ever identical. You can make different choices with every run such as which next path to take, which card to buy/sell at the store, or even which character you want to play with altogether.
•There is no real "end" as you can continue to reclimb the tower with harder difficulties and overall debuffs attached.
•There are many mods available in the workshop in the forms of custom characters, custom decks, new game modes, new bosses, powerful relics, and more.
WEAKNESSES:
•Not a real criticism of the game, but attempting to build certain decks to obtain some achievements is highly RNG dependent and thus if you are a completionist, you might find yourself spending hours upon hours doing so.
NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):
9.5/10
Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. "Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards" is a waste of everyone's time. If you are interested in genuine & detailed game reviews, feel free to check out my others here (or don't, I don't tell you what to do).

Would eat edibles and play for 16 hours straight again. 10/10

After 500+ hours, 50+ mods, and the game perfected - I guess I should leave a review.
Simply put - my favorite game of all time.

I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss.
Of course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.
This is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.
There is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again.
I recommend it for everyone =)

Slay the Spire is an absolute masterpiece of a game that I have had the pleasure of playing on multiple consoles. This unique blend of roguelike and deck-building mechanics has kept me hooked for countless hours, offering a challenging and strategic experience.
First and foremost, the game's concept is brilliant. As a player, you embark on a journey up the Spire, battling through various encounters and collecting powerful cards to build your deck. The combination of roguelike elements, where each run is different, and the addictive deck-building mechanics creates an engaging and ever-changing gameplay experience.
The gameplay itself is a perfect balance of strategy and decision-making. Each turn, you must carefully plan your moves, utilizing the cards in your deck to defeat enemies and overcome obstacles. The variety of cards and their synergies provide endless possibilities for creative strategies, ensuring that no two runs are the same.
The game's visuals are minimalist yet elegant, with each character and enemy beautifully designed. The atmospheric soundtrack perfectly complements the intense battles, immersing you in the world of Slay the Spire.
Furthermore, the game's replayability is outstanding. With multiple characters to choose from, each with their own unique playstyle, and a variety of unlockable cards and relics, Slay the Spire offers endless hours of gameplay. The challenging difficulty and the desire to discover new strategies keep me coming back for more.
In conclusion, Slay the Spire is an exceptional roguelike deck-building game that has captivated me across multiple platforms. Its strategic gameplay, endless replayability, and commitment to multiple consoles make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Whether you're a veteran of card games or new to the genre, this game will undoubtedly provide hours of challenging and rewarding gameplay.

Pros: fun and interesting; each character plays differently, there's a lot of unhinged combo bs you can go hard on, neat modding community, lots of different difficulty and replayability options.
Cons: you WILL be bad at math 1 or more times and you WILL be sad about it.
