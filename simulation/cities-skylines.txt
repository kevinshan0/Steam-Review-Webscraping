Imagine being EA and screwing up SimCity so much, that someone in Finland got fed up and made a better game.

I for one can tell you if you are looking for a city building sim, THIS is what you are looking for, little note to the developer: If you make a game with over $300 of DLC. people will be discouraged from buying,

I like playing cities alot. I have Cerebral Palsy and use a HeadMouse to work the computer. Its one of the few games that will work with my HeadMouse. Its hard finding games that I can play because I don't have use of my hands. I would recomme it to anyone with a disability.

This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.
Positives
* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.
* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.
* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.
* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.
Negatives
* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000.
* Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.
* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say "100 per week" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.
Conclusion
If you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.

In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect. I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.
Everything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game. And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.
Now pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5.
The game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time. The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach. The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'. A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand. The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for. I can not possibly reccomend this more.

This really is the greatest city simulator there is, and will be for quite a long time. I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.
Some of the things worth noting:
- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.
- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.
- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.
- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.
- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.
- This list just goes on and on...
The only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.
Just a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game. :P
To sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them. You'll love it.

For 2 weeks I debated purchasing Cities: Skylines (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, "screw it" and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.
In a nut shell, Cities: Skylines is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite. Cities: Skylines goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You're required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.
---------------------------------------------------------
Pros
+ Replayability value is here 100%
+ Sound effects are great and very life-like
+ The graphics, my oh my, the graphics - they are absolutely stunning; if you're able to play on high graphics, then go for it. The view is very rewarding and satisfying. Great job, Colossal!
+ There is always something to look out for: budgeting, job and housing demands, etc. This game is definitely no joke. It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idle
+ Related to the graphics point: I love how this game works so well on my non-gaming laptop. I have a Toshiba E45T which is not one by any means. This game is so well optimised, I can still enjoy it to its fullest though
+ The "basic" version of Cities: Skylines offers a lot at a decent price. If your budget is fairly tight, then disregard the Deluxe Edition unless you really want 5 extra monuments (plus as a way to support the developer's further). You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshop
Neutral
± DLC's are a bit pricey and I'm not sure if it's really worth it. In the end, it's your call
Update 26 May, 2016: I've finally gotten around to purchasing both DLC's and I'll provide a brief breakdown.
After Dark DLC: comes with some new lanes and a couple edicts, leisure and tourism specializations (night clubs, etc.), and extra buildings. Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cycle, but I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC... maybe I'm just confusing something!
Snowfall DLC: snow, obviously, hah! Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems.
Verdict: In my opinion, the DLC's are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer's as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC's are cheaper (I'd say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC's completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you're an achievement hunter like me, then you'll need to purchase the DLC's.
If budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting After Dark first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it's far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven't even really played with Snowfall since it doesn't offer much beyond its name. It's completely up to you!
Cons
- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)
- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful
- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you're looking to upgrade them
- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)
---------------------------------------------------------
All in all, Cities: Skylines is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I've already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I've exited the game. If you're into simulators, I highly recommend this one - I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on me.
With an abundance of content and a plethora of mods being developed (or already developed), you seriously can't go wrong with this title. Bravo, Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive, bravo: thank you for this amazing game.
Overall
9.5/10
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask - I will answer them to the best of my ability. On that note, cheers and happy building!
---------------------------------------------------------
Update 11 June, 2016: FREE STADIUM DLC! Thank you, Colossal Order - this game just gets better and better. You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your game.
---------------------------------------------------------
Worthy Questions & Answers
1) Can this game be played offline (credits to ru): Yes, yes this game can be played offline! I've done around 7 hours of gameplay offline (due to power outages). That didn't stop me from getting on this game though!
2) Does the game require a lot of attention (credits to ru): the great thing about this game is that, while it does require micromanagement, it doesn't necessarily need a lot. You can leave the game in order to run an errand if you choose. I've left it for around 10 minutes before - always came back to a 99% operational city (those dead bodies, yo. Keep piling up!)

Cities Skylines Review
Its been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.
I have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.
There is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens.
Transportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.
I could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The "Chirper" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value.
In fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.
The Good:
========
+ Solid graphics and rich detail
+ Realistic simulation elements
+ Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings
+ Variety of buildings
+ Many customization options
+ Easy-to-use UI
+ Extremely high replay value
+ Mod-friendly with editting tools included
+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements
+ Pleasant audio/background music
The Bad:
======
- Lack of random events/natural disasters
- Graphics could be more life-like
- Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplay
Final Thoughts:
===========
Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games.

This is a truncated version of this video review:

If you’ve longed for another great city-builder like I have, or simply want to try one for the first time, I don’t hesitate at all in saying Cities Skylines is a superb choice.
Skylines is a proper old school city-builder. As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. I’ve spent about 40 hours on it so far, so the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Well, in a word, YES.
As is tradition, you start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal. Generally the goal is to build a city, grow it as big as you like, and make sure it doesn’t die. You have a single highway connection to start out with, which acts as the first of many entrances to your city. Use the road tools to draw some roads, and you’ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them. These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residential, commercial, and industrial, which will become homes, shops, and factories. Although more come into play later on, like high-density residential and commercial zones, as well as office zones, the central system of RCI demand is very much in play here. The more demand for a zone you have, the more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll require, so you’ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city. Beyond these basics, it’s totally up to you as to what’s next.
And thankfully you’re not limited to your initial map size. That starting plot of land is 2 square kilometers, but once you start reaching its borders, you have the option to buy more, up to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam.) Although, sometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logic, mostly regarding traffic, services, and lack of UI information. But once I started to figure these systems out, the challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding. Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easy, and if you screwed those cities up, that was a real feat of ineptitude. Here, a doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circle, and that’s kind of awesome. But it doesn't feel cheap, it feels like something to learn from and perform better next time. There are also some included mods from the developers, which act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options. And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made mods, with a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop support.
Let me just say it: This is the game I’ve been craving since SimCity 4. My few complaints are just drops in a sea of truly satisfying gameplay. It’s the kind of game that I can play for so many hours at a time that when I leave, I start seeing zone layouts in my ceiling, and traffic patterns in my cereal. Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land value, city services, and mass transit systems and be completely content. It’s blissful, stressful, and compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore. There are so many details that I love, like the way you can paint zones with different brushes, the sweeping orchestral soundtrack, the guidelines that appear when placing roads, the fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperly, the way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shape, and on and on.
And it runs great too, even when surpassing 100,000 citizens, it still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop. Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace.) And all this with a comparatively small budget, a team of a dozen or so people, and the Unity Engine. Just... wow. Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and man is it a beautiful thing to behold. And the price... you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price. Folks, this is what I like to call “doing it right”. They could’ve charged double and I still would recommend it, but wow. This is a top-notch game at a bargain launch price, and it makes me want to cry tears of joy.

Alright, let me start this off with this. If you already love city-builders, this is for you. If you don't already like city-builders, this is a great place to start!
I personally love city-building games and I can't really believe that many of the things that they acomplished (either totally or partially) were done. The traffic AI has been
greatly improved since release.
Pros:
- CURVY ROADS
- Adustable height of the roads allowing for customized interchanges
- Renewable Energy is the main power source that you will use.
- Train/Subway/Bus Routs are editable and can be color coordinated.
- Cities grow based upon services and leisure and educated near them.
- Mods, 74,000+ mods.
- Intuituve Menu Layout
- Great AI
- Base Game is worth the price
Cons:
- DLC has too little content for too high a price.
Yeah that's all the cons. If I had to I would give this game a very nice 93/100. It's got a lot of polish added to it and it's worth every cent you put into it. Buy this, you won't regret it at all.
Posted: March 26, 2015
Let me give you a history lesson.
In 1989 Simcity was relased. And it was great.
In 1994 SimCity 2000 was released and it was great.
In 1999 SC3k was released, and it was also, great. (Are you seeing a theme here?)
In 2003, SimCity 4 was released, and it was perfection.
Now... it gets sad.
2007 brought us SimCity Socities, which was a thing.
And in 2013 brought us Sim City. And Im sure you know what its miraid of problems was.
Now finally, 12 years after the last great city building game comes Skylines.
By NOT trying to do all the interconnected and multiplayer garbage that sunk a decade of titles, Collossal Order has hit one out of the park. Runs great on older machines, looks great, and has GREAT mod support.
In all honesty, while writing the introduction I was trying to think of a negative element that came up. Still dont have one.
Buy this game.

In my humble opinion, this is one of the best games ever created. Unlimited replay value due to mod support and one heck of a vanilla game that is flexible, yet well structured. Excellent game that each of the DLCs has made better!
Posted: March 14, 2015
Pros:
+ Game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder
+Built in modding tools
+Beautiful Graphics
+It's challanging (learning curve)
+No lag, and I have a computer that doesn't meet the requirements
+Lots of replayability
Cons:
-takes over your life

Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic.
Cities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way. Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.
This is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.
First up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.
The gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.
You’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.
The game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!
Industries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb.
The game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.
Surprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.
The icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.
Now you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?
The game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.
There is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.
The camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!
Not a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.
There is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!
In conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.
Sim City, eat your heart out.

1. watch a tutorial on how to start in the game.
2.play the game 10 hours without a break because its too addictive
3. destroy the whole city.

Without a doubt one of the best City Builders of all time. The price is so reasonable for the amount of quality content you get both from the default game and from all the modders on the Steam workshop. I'm so looking forward to what new things will be released in the future for this game. The Developers also listen to their customers and have been adding more modding tools for us to use to create new assets for players. Thanks CO!

So I made my first city, getting it from zero to eight thousand when I finally unlocked dams. At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.
All in all an absolutely hilarious experiance. Great game.

- Modding from day one
- Every citizen simulated
- Agent system works on launch
- No EXTERNAL DRM (You know, except for Steam)
- No always online
- No forced multiplayer aspect
- Not published by EA
- Published by Paradox
- Better than SimCity
- Half the price then SimCity when you compare them at launch price
- Actually fun
See EA? This is how you make a city builder.
RIP Maxis Emeryville, but don't worry, the genre is in safe hands. Colossal Order's hands.

1. Build a road
2. Make houses by the road.
3. Make factories to make money.
4. Your people accidentaly drink sewage water,
5. Population decline
6. After 30 minutes resolving the problem you decide to flood the whole city,
7. Build a new city with a new industry and with a better sewage system.
8. Business is booming.
9. People are dumb.
10. You make them smart.
11. Now they are too smart.
12. After a hour of trying to resolve the problem you quit.
10/10 game would reccomend.

Let's start with this: it is an amazing city building game. It's the best in generations. BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.
MAP SIZE: 10/10
The city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.
AI: 7/10
They all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.
INTERFACE: 9/10
The interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.
HOW IT RUNS: 10/10
It runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities. For an example, watch this video:

Views: 0
THINGS TO DO: 9/10
There is a LOT to do, from perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes. The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasters, which in my opinion is something required for a city building game.
DIVERSITY: 9/10
The only reason it is 9/10 is because the building colors are almost identical and painted-looking. Despite this, you can model your own buildings :)
DIFFICULTY: (not how hard the game is) 9/10
The only reason it is difficult is when you get to huge cities it becomes literally difficult with everything in your face all at once.
GRAPHICS: (for the average graphics of the time of the release date) 9/10
They are amazing. I've seen better, but it is still great. It has it's own style.
CLUTTER: 8/10
Ugh, when your in a city trying to build, pop ups everywhere makes it hard to work..
PRICE: 10/10
For this great of a game, it is very cheap at the time of it's release.
OVERALL SCORE:
90% To Perfect
Would I recommend this? Yes!
Posted: March 27, 2015
Things I can do in Cities: Skylines that I couldn't do in SimCity (5)
- Play without an internet connection
- Name my city something rude like PantyFlash
- Edit terrain in a nice map editor
- Play without logging into Origin...
- Actually have simulated people whose actions make sense
*** Every person has their own name and a constant house where they live ***
- Manage traffic properly
- Have fun
I have been a big SimCity fan for many years. I've collected the games and have tried my best to stay loyal to the brand because most SimCity games brought me many hours of gameplay and joy. When SimCity Societies came out, I received it for free with another game I had purchased. I must admit... it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something different.
Then SimCity (5) happened... I was one of those suckers that actually went out and bought a hard copy of the game the day it released. Heck I had been waiting for about 10 years and when I spent what is roughly $45 dollars I thought it was worth it because this is SimCity! I played the game for about a week and then went played SimCity 2000 instead. Yes that's right, I would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013. And when SimCity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after release, I was done. Done with SimCity. A game that I have played and loved my entire life. The first PC game I owned other than solitaire and that crazy pinball game that came with Microsoft =.=.
So long live Cities: Skylines. Long live Collosal Order.
9/10
PS: Found a link earlier this week about Maxis and EA. Apparently EA is closing Maxis down. Give it a read. http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/03/04/its-a-sim-ea-closes-simssimcity-developer-maxis/ What do you guys think about this? Feel free to comment.
Also please keep in mind that the comments made on SimCity 5 are based on my experience with the game when it originally released and not patches and ammendments that have been made to the game since then.
Posted: February 16, 2023
I just dont understand why you have to spend 230$ for things that should already be in the game for free.
Posted: October 24, 2018
You know a game is good when you wake up in the morning, turn on your PC, and play it until you sleep at night, skipping brushing your teeth, bathing, and even eating.
For me, this is one of those games.

Hi. I'm an asset creator for this game, which is to say I make custom Workshop content so people can have something interesting and different to look at in their cities. I am not the best asset creator for this game - but I really love doing it.
If Cities:Skylines didn't exist, I wouldn't have bothered to learn how to create 3D game assets and models, texture said models, nor would I have met some fantastic people who share the same interest. I've always loved city builders, all the way back since SimCity on the SNES - and this one really scratches that itch. The enthusiasm and diversity of this community can not be understated. As a Canadian, I've met people from the U.K., Kazakhstan, Russia, France, Japan, the U.S. - and some of my fellow countrymen - and all have shared that enthusiasm. In terms of a competent and accommodating community, Cities:Skylines is hard to beat.
As a city builder, it's competent. It is better than the latest SimCity (2013), which is part of the reason why this game did so well. But it's not without its flaws. The thing is, though, like all cult classic games, you won't have a reason to complain about anything until you're deep enough in to call yourself a fan.
The base game is worth the price of admission outside of a sale. You should experience it if you have any interest in city builders. As it is a Paradox published title, there is a considerable amount of DLC, which some, sometimes, including myself, find disagreeable. My recommendation here is to purchase the After Dark and Mass Transit DLCs at any cost and go for the Snowfall, Natural Disasters and Green Cities when you can get them at a good price. All DLCs add something worthwhile to the game - but After Dark and Mass Transit, to me, were the most beneficial to gameplay.
Also, if you decide to purchase - ensure you have a decent supply of RAM before loading up on custom content. The minimum requirement for the game is 4gb - but I would recommend 8 (16 or more, if you can afford it. It's a Unity thing.).
The grassroots nature of Cities:Skylines is its greatest virtue. It's one of those few striking games that really exemplifies 'We, the people.' It is so many things to such a diverse crowd.
So, if you're a builder type, and you're hedging on it, you have my recommendation.

Pros
++Very accessible to new players, but has enough depth to satisfy veterans of the genre
++Each citizen has a real life, simulated 24/7 to the point where you can follow everyone around to find exactly where they live and where they work.
+Huge cities with 36 square kilometer area for building, expandable through mods to 100 square kilometers
+Runs well on my GTX 770 and i5 3.8ghz CPU on max settings
+Day 1 modding and Steam works integration
+Custom ingame asset and map editors
Cons
--No day or night cycle, meaning no rush hours or changes in traffic patterns
-Lack of depth in a few of the systems (wind and crime specifically)
-Dams are buggy, can cause massive unnatural flooding if they stop working correctly.
-Bigger cities can reduce performance
-Building styles are repetitive, often times 3 or more of the same store or house end up being built next to each other
If you like city builders, this is honestly the best one to come out in years. Cities: Skylines allows you to easily build huge cities without restriction that truly feel alive with the real time simulation of ALL the citizens. Rename and customize everything, even custom buildings and maps can be created in the in game editors included. And with a very fair $30 price tag, there is honestly no reason outside of a few minor bugs to not play Cities: Skylines.
Posted: December 29, 2022
The only game that makes you think about getting 64gb ram for your system.
Posted: October 16, 2022
I unironically spent like 2 hours min-maxing the traffic lanes for my roundabouts, only to unlock buses and reduce traffic in my city by like half.
On the plus side, after being immersed in the community for this game, I'm now hypercritical of real life city and road design and break down into tears upon seeing poor intersection layouts.
Posted: April 29, 2015
Finally, the city builder everyone was expecting, and still wanted.
+ Devs who listen and care
+ Map sizes
+ Clean graphics
+ Chirpy
+ Insane modding community
+ No seriously, the workshop for this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy
+ I just flew a plane through my city. These mods are ridiculous.
- No day/night cycle or online mutiplayer [EDIT: After Dark day/night cycle added for FREE]
- ... who cares though, the rest of the game is more than enough and then some
I'd also like to mention.... R.I.P. Maxis.
There should be an in-game memorial park in their honor for Cims to pay homage to, and an EA park in which homeless vagrants can do what homeless vagrants do.
This is how you give a gaming community what it wants, and how you're paid in return - by asking what it wants and listening to what it asks for. Not telling it what it needs instead.
Take notes, EA.
10/10
Posted: March 14, 2015
My first city went bankrupt, the second was washed away by flood (don't ask), third drowned in sewage, my fourth and current city (as of this writing) is doing fine but city layout is horrible - traffic jams everywhere.
This game refuses to hold my hand, as it should. Played for 12 hours straight - reluctant to leave my computer to shower, eat and go to the bathroom. Basic needs are for losers.
Posted: November 11, 2022
Dang, 1,000 hours of Cities and I still have no idea what I am doing.
Sounds familiar? This is you, too? Well then, that's because Colossal Order has brought a new era to City building simulation.
But they didn't do it alone. I am not talking about Paradox Interactive only, I am talking about the community.
Yes, this is one of those games, where the community not only kept this game very much alive to this day, but enriched and has even done a better job in some aspects than the developers themselves.
So what you see in Vanilla Cities in 2022, is not even close to the experiences you unlock with a little help from the Steam Workshop. Yes, yadda yadda, city building simulator, forget about the *cough cough* other ones , the games you used to play when you were little. Cities: Skylines takes the cake. But let's talk about a few pointers before you put this one into your virtual shopping cart:
- You just wanna play the vanilla game and chill away for a bit? You can absolutely do that, but if you're enjoying yourself and also find yourself building a new city over and over again to "do it right this time", then please try out mods, you will not regret it.
- Once you do that and suddenly your desk turns into a city building planner's office, then commit to it. A new city is like a blank canvas for you to create and once you have created and you see everything working, you're going to feel VERY satisfied.
- Feeling all satisfied and stuff, do one thing for me as well: If you do dive into the workshop and try one or say five hundred out of the bazillion mods that exist: Do favourite and give a "like" to the creators, it's only one mouseclick after all. These boys and girls spend their precious time to make beautiful and awesome stuff for you to use for free. The least we can do is show them our appreciation and try to help them improve if necessary.
- Speaking of appreciation: You will notice that while the base game of Cities: Skylines is rated quite positively, most of the DLC's and Content Creator Packs are often viewed as a "mixed" bag.
To be clear: Yes, some DLC might not be for you and no, you don't NEED to have them all. BUT (!) They do add more variety to the game, they do enhance the experience. Choose carefully which ones are for you and keep in mind that this game can entertain you for 1000's of hours (as it has with me) and I am COMPLETELY fine with Paradox releasing several new DLC's every year, along with the content creator packs. The pricing is mostly fair and I have so far not been disappointed. (That's not to say there are no flaws or room for improvement!)
I believe Cities will continue to rock for a few more years, until a successor is on the horizon to again lift city building simulation to the next level. A big, massive, huge thumbs up from me!

All old people die simultaneously. Drivers can't make a U-turn unless the road has ended. No one tries to avoid traffic jams. Twitter is annoying.
10/10 for realism
Posted: December 14, 2023
Better than Cities: Skylines 2.
Posted: September 4, 2018
Really cool city builder/simulation. Biggest downside is the shear amount of content locked behind a DLC paywall. Some of the DLC's like Natural Disasters should've been included with the base game.
Posted: June 21, 2017
It is a great game but has one huge flaw.
The DLC's. They are overpriced and two of the more costly DLC's should be in the base game.
Pros
- Good gameplay
- Fun tax system
- a good budget system
- no lag until later stages of game
- good way of finding out what your people need
Cons
- Bad DLC prices
- foundation is in the DLC's
The game is worth the price but the DLC's are bad in price and content for the price they give
Posted: December 14, 2022
I used to love this game. After the failure of SimCity this had appeared as the game I wanted straight from the beginning... but now I just can't bare to play it a second longer. The way Paradox runs this game is such a parasitic and greedy way. And that has to do with their DLC
The DLC is getting ridiculous. Paradox is really getting lazy on their work to milk as much money as they can out of their fanbase. Even the trailer video for their recent financial DLC shows their lazyness with how lackluster and boring it is. And the more they release these little content packs, the more you realize how much they've been setting this up from the start. You want a financial institution in your city management game? Well buy it as DLC. Want airports? Buy it as DLC. Want shipping and tourist boats? Buy it as DLC. Want to really design the industry in your city? Buy it as DLC. Want some cool tourism features in your city? Buy it as DLC. Want some universities in your city? Buy it as DLC. Want some night life for you city? But it as DLC. Want some weather system in your city? Buy it as DLC? Want catastrophes that have been a trope of city management games since Sim City? Buy it as a DLC.
DLC DLC DLC DLC!!!
I'm getting so sick of all these little bits of DLC. What happened to the older generations of games where a company sold maybe 3-4 expansion DLC at most that were a solid 20-40$ each, but individually had enough content equivalent to half of the base game?
We're at 330$ worth of DLC everyone, but don't worry. I'm sure they'll have a subscription service here soon like they've started doing for their other games as they continue to release more overpriced little micro DLC of content you'd expect to be apart of a simulation game by default.

Cities: Skylines
Note: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.
Field	Rating	Review
Graphics	
8
	The design in Skylines is certainly well thought out. A balance between looking good, and performing well. While not top of the line graphics, Skylines found a sweet medium between realism and cartoony that actually works rather well. It's not distracting in any way, and you wouldn't really notice until you zoomed in close to individual cars and people. The city feels alive and bustling, and the game still performs well at large simulation levels. The interface is very, very well thought out, along with each of the overlays. It is clear they are all heavily inspired by Sim City (the good ones), which isn't a bad thing. Why fix what isn't broke?
Gameplay	
9.5
	This is what city-builders have been waiting for, for a long time. Ever since Sim City 4, city building games have either performed poorly, or massively under-delivered gameplay wise. Skylines has come onto the field full force, and delivers a polished, seamless world to build in, with a gigantic area to boot. Manage your water lines, power, trash, health care, leisure, and more. Of particular note are the public transit routes, refined by the former Cities in Motion games. Also of mention is the small, but wonderful ability to create districts which allow you to section out portions of your city and assign each of them unique names and policies (no high-rises, less water use, etc). Skylines took plenty of notes from the old city builder games we all loved, and refined the experience into something absolutely wonderful. They've even included a mode to allow you to play with unlimited money, and everything unlocked, so you can build without worry and create the city you've always dreamed of! The only minor frustrations that have emerged are some struggles with boats and routes for roads, but that could be my lack of patience for getting down into the nitty-gritty details of layout.
Story	
N/A
	No story here, besides the one you mutter to yourself as you cut off your city's water supply.
Multiplayer	
N/A
	No multiplayer in Cities: Skylines.
Replayability	
10
	This nearly comes with the territory of city building games. They always call you back to try creating a different city, or try new ideas with your layout. Or perhaps unleash havoc on the city to just...see what happens. Take all that joy, polish it, and you have Cities: Skylines, at your beck and call.
Overall
	
9.6/10
	If you have been waiting for a worthy successor to Sim City 4, you have just found it. With free content updates down the road, Steam Workshop support, and developer's that listen to their audience, Cities: Skylines has everything good going for it, and my does it sing its song well. From the refined interface, to the focus upon you having control over your city, to the sheer size of the cities you can create; Cities: Skylines delivers on every front, and is exactly the city-builder game you hoped it would be. Though it isn't revolutionary in any of its gameplay elements, it has risen to the challenge that was so long failed, and now carries the torch of the city-building genre. Highly recommended, now get out there and build the city you've always dreamed of, and be sure to stop by the Steam Workshop for some neat mods!

22-01-2020 Paradox released an update that included their own launcher and updated EULA.
Once you launch the game through the steam shortcut, it will install their launcher without consent, as malware behaves, and on finishing you are greeting by an updated EULA that states that they are collecting information (that they can't get through steam) and share with their affiliates.
Some of us who bought the game under the original EULA aren't a fan, many more not of another launcher you need to launch through the steam launcher.
"But you can just decline!"
You could, but then you are locked out of your copy of the game you bought plus all the dlc's without the ability to stay on the last version befor this amended EULA.
Besides that, there isn't even a decline button and for that matter, not even an accept one!
https://i.imgur.com/MCkxeWs.png
It is just f'ing amazing that Steam is allowing companies to distribute their own launchers that send people to their own stores without consequences.
Great game, but I will not tolerate this crap from Paradox.
Small change as I just saw the joke in it:
This launcher isn't "spyware", it's actually ransomware (3 new EULA's), lol
Originally posted by Azure:
You're completely welcome to post about the launcher, and give feedback no matter how harsh. We listen to all our players
We are deleting threads that are:
- Nothing but personal insults or threats
- Spreading misinformation, such as about the launcher being spyware. Debating whether I should just post the very short list of what things the launcher actually does track. The EULA is the exact same, you just have to re-agree to it. You can even see the date on it is years old
We agreed to the EULA in steam.
I will not agree to the EULA in a stand alone program that is installed without consent and definitely not wanted.
It might not be spyware, but it's definitely ransomeware as I can not access the game through the platform I bought it.
Anyone with a braincell knows you are going to patch that workaround the first chance you get, for obvious reasons.
You changed the terms of the contract when we bought the game (5 years ago!) to require additional software to run it, now enjoy the ride you programmed and saw coming per the title of the patch note.

Edit 31-0-2020:
This launcher is now to stay:

Instead of reverting this update that bricked the game for many players, they are sticking to it instead of fixing it internally and then try again.
They made it very clear they don't care about their customers.
I would highly recommend to avoid any Paradox published games and if you must play them, go the "unofficial" route because what you buy is not what you keep and they will gladly ♥♥♥♥ you over at any time.
The next EA cancer is officially here, so I vote with my wallet and horrible mouth to mouth advice regardig any of their titles.
Ps; Steam doesn't gives a ♥♥♥♥ either so consider buying from GoG instead of Steam for single player games.
On a tiny little detour for all you future wannabe community managers, don't be a jackass to your players, they will be one right back at you ;)

TLDR; Buy this game if you enjoy the genre and felt like SC5 was a piece of crap.
PROS:
-Day one MOD SUPPORT! Amazing!
-No EA
-No Always online ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
-No Origin
-Big city limits (suck it SC5)
-Graphics
-Very detailed city simulation, down to individual citizens
-Water simulation!
-Finnish game studio
-Friend works in the company.
-No EA
CONS:
-Public transportation lines are difficult to edit afterwards, when you got many of them and some overlapping. Would be very helpful to be able to isolate them for easier editing.
-Tree placing should be a brush ( There's a nice mod that fixes this )
-No autosaving ( There's a mod that fixes this )
-No disasters
-No time of day, different weather effects and seasons.

I'm terrible at city-building games. JUST TERRIBLE. You know the "city advisor" features in most games of this type? They are ALWAYS unhappy with me. "What, are you an idiot?" they say.
Okay, so I'm not a strategic thinker, so I play city-building games like a painter with a brush, or like Tetris without the disappearing blocks. I think zero moves ahead. I can't think ahead. I'm terrible at chess, too. I just like to build things and watch them evolve, and then tear them down again.
Why does this matter in a review of Cities: Skylines? It matters because the game lets me play this way and doesn't penalize me. I can ignore city advisors, or the little twitter feed at the top of the page. I can build a sprawling eco-friendly suburbia or a toxic metropolitan nightmare, and it just lets me do it. Some people bemoan the lack of complex city-building features in this game--and it's true they're adding more all the time--but I celebrate that Colossal Order has realized that people like me exist.
The game requires absurdly high specs to run smoothly. One day I hope to upgrade my PC so I can dump sewer water into Shady Acres without an inferiority complex to dampen my malevolent glee.

I made a dam to generate hydroelectric power, my entire city flooded and since i spent so much money on the dam not even the bailout saved me and i went bankrupt. 11/10 would drown my people again.

It's one of those game that you will binge for 10 to 15 hours straight, and then never play it again for months only to pick it up again.

Welp, I suppose I better finally leave a review now that I've spent 3% of my life on the game.

STOP ADDING YOUR LAUNCHER TO GAMES ON STEAM! If I buy your game on Steam, I don't want to buy a shortcut to your launcher just to launch the damn game. The same thing happened to Kerbal Space Program too, quit it.

Colossal order releases a city-building simulator. Millions of copies sold. A couple of months later developer makes an announcement:"We are sorry, that we didn't include tunnels and European buildings in the initial release of the game. Here, take them for free".

Q: What I think of this game?
A: Best city builder game I played... ever... period
Q: What I don’t like about it?
A: Traffic does need to be fine tuned, and I feel mods are necessary to balance the game, but it's very tedious...
Q: What about user generated content?
A: Workshop community has been very impressive, adding so many cool things to the game.
I am at a point where I feel I am missing out on amazing mods and content, because there are so many to choose from, and I can't invest the time to try them all.
But how can you really complain from having too much choice, so forget I just said that...
Q: Does it worth the price?
A: Price might seem a bit steep to some, but for any fan of city builder games, you'll get your money's worth in the first week... and probably lose a bit of grasp on reality at the same time.
Bottom line, you will get a lot more then what you pay for, so why wait?
Q: What I would love to see added to the game?
A: I would like to see some scenarios of some kind being added.
Milestones are great, and sandbox opens so many possibilities... yet still, I would like to have the option of being guided or limited to specific objectives.
It would help me understand some parts of the game better, and bring my game to another level.
Q: What are my advices when playing the game?
A: The game expects you to be a pro at this; you'll have to make a lot of mistakes before you find your way.
It's easy to "cheat" the game, but it will not make it more fun.
- Watch tutorials to get some ideas
- Use mods with caution, they can improve the game, but can also break it...
- Help rating user generated content, rating takes 5 seconds and creators should get recognition for their work
- Make suggestions, Colossal Order and Paradox are listening to the feedback and are not wasting any time
Q: What would I like to say to Paradox and Colossal Order’s team?
A: You have given me what I was waiting for! THANK YOU!
But you have also stolen 100 hours of my life already... Are you proud? I am sure you are ;)
You’ve set new standards in the way a game should be delivered to the community and updated based on user feedback, and all gamers will benefit from your work.
Kudos to everyone!!!
Q: Where am I going?
A: Sorry, I have a city to build... goodbye!

Cities: Skylines is, perhaps, the best modern city builder available – at least until Cities: Skylines 2 is released this October. It’s an addictive game that lets you unleash your creativity as an omnipotent mayor/deity, building the city of your dreams and controlling everything from the road hierarchy to the production chain. It offers a relaxing gameplay loop with fantastic simulation that makes your city feel alive! Every civilian, or ‘cim’, has their own life. They go to school or work, go shopping, visit friends, and go back home. They park, visit parks, take public transport, or just walk or bike around. Just following a random civilian around to see what they get up to is a fun experience in and of itself!
The challenge of the game comes primarily from money management, zone planning, and traffic management. You’ll likely find yourself struggling to maintain a decent traffic flow, which is one of the main challenges of the game. However, you can play Cities: Skylines as you wish – enable ‘Hard Mode’ for a greater challenge or enable unlimited money and soil, and ‘Unlock All’, for an experience more akin to a sandbox game.
Cities: Skylines offers a variety of special buildings – clinics, hospitals, fire stations, police headquarters, and so on, most of which aren’t just cosmetic, serving actual purposes within your city. By purchasing some of the 62 DLC packs the game has to offer, you’ll be able to unlock even more content! For lists of the best DLCs, check out the r/CitiesSkylines wiki.
It’s never been more fun to create and manage a city than in Cities: Skylines, and better yet, the game has a fantastic modding community with thousands of amazing mods! Most of them are assests – mainly buildings that you can add to your game – but a lot of them affect gameplay or visuals. Some of the most notable mods include Traffic Manager: President Edition, Find It! 2, Move It, Prop Control, and Network Anarchy – all of which, and more, I would consider to be essential mods. Click here for my collection of essential mods.
Modding Cities: Skylines allows you to achieve so much more than the base game could ever offer, allowing you to achieve much smarter and realistic traffic, the ability to place any building you want anywhere, and more – not to mention assets that let you truly build the city of your dreams. You’ll find an asset on the Workshop for almost any city or country you can think of, so by downloading assets, you’ll be able to create a truly Japanese, American, Scandinavian, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese (the list goes on…) city, not to mention the many originally crafted assets and assets inspired by films and video games.
Now, one of the issues that I, and many others, have with this game is that it’s yet another game that suffers from ‘greedy developers syndrome’. Whilst most of the DLC is well-made, I’d also consider almost all the DLC packs to be too expensive, especially considering the sheer number of them. Some of the packs are quite necessary to have to get decent enjoyment out of the game – such as After Dark and Green Cities – whereas some are just collections of some assets and are not worth the price (mainly the ‘content creator packs’ – i.e., mods that aren’t free).
A lot of the DLC packs contain content that should’ve been in the base game, and it’s a hard sell when the more expensive ‘Deluxe Edition’ of the game contains precisely zero of the game’s DLC packs. Purchasing all of the game’s DLC, not including the game itself and not accounting for sales, would cost you 392 € (429 USD) at the time of writing this. That’s just too much. I’m someone who appreciates DLC in games, but not when it’s overpriced and excessive, especially when a good chunk of the DLC packs are just a few assets thrown together.
If you do decide to get this game, I would wait for a discount, and definitely get the DLCs that you want when they, too, are discounted. Get the New Player Bundle and other essential DLCs when it’s on sale – or the Cities: Skylines Collection if it has a really good sale (otherwise, it’s far too expensive, at 344 € as of writing this.
Conclusion
Cities: Skylines is a fabulous city builder – arguably the best one out there, until the sequel comes out later this year. It’s a game that offers endless replay value, with an unlimited number of ways to build and maintain your city. It offers engaging and relaxing gameplay (until you get stuck with 41% traffic flow, that is) and, assuming you have at least six of the best DLC packs, offers a lot of content to keep the gameplay engaging.
Negatives include expensive and excessive DLC, somewhat frequent bugs (although most of them visual), and relatively outdated graphics, but for a city builder, it still looks great! Ultimately, I would certainly recommend Cities: Skylines, especially if you’ve enjoyed games like SimCity in the past. Cities: Skylines is a highly polished, refined, and modern take on the city building game.
However, if you’re willing to wait, I would recommend waiting for Cities: Skylines II. That game looks absolutely phenomenal – although you do have to expect that the game will be somewhat lacklustre content-wise at launch, especially considering that the developers stated that there won’t even be any bikes in the game upon release (source).

Cities: Skylines
...is a city building simulator. Build a city from the grounds up, managing the budget and city services for a population that is increasingly demanding as it grows. This review takes into account all DLCs.
⚙ Game Description & Mechanics ⚙
If you ever played a game from the SimCity franchise, you'll feel right at home. After selecting your map and preferences, you begin from a highway offramp from which you lay your first road, which will include buildable areas on either side (as permitted by the terrain). You can either zone for residential, commercial and industrial buildings to pop up, or build specific utility and city service buildings. You must also make sure that buildings have access to electricity (electricity is shared across a short radius, or can be transported further away by laying power lines) which will require constructing a power plant, and water/sewage (combine pipes are laid underground) which have separate water intake and waste outtake facilities.
As your population grows, you unlock additional buildings and services, but your citizen's expectations will also grow. While the first citizens will make due with electricity, water and access to places where they work and shop, the first milestone will unlock elementary schools and garbage dump along with the citizen expectations that kids must have access to early education and that garbage disposal is available. The following milestone will unlock police and firefighter stations, and your citizens will expect you to supply them with these services. Further milestones include new road types, public transport, city policies, high-density zoning, and the possibility to increase the area of the map you can build on. Each time you unlock a milestone, you're also given a cash grant, allowing you to quickly implement the new services, or at least get your head of the water if you were having a hard time with your finance.
City planning also includes multiple layers of district management. City districts allow you to implement city policies (low-traffic area, industrial specialization, zone-specific tax raises or reliefs, etc.) on an area without it being citywide. Park districts allow you to free-build parks (city park, nature reserve, theme parks or zoos) instead of relying on pre-built flat parks. Industrial district opens the option of digging into the nitty-gritty aspects of resources gathering and production-chain management of the core industries (agriculture, forestry, ore and oil). Educational districts allow you to establish large campus-style higher education facilities with all the faculty, varsity sports, and other services found in the world's best colleges and universities. But as overwhelming as this sounds, districts are entirely optional, and can reasonably be skipped by new or casual city builders.
☺ What I enjoyed ☺
The game looks great with intricate models and gorgeous night-time lighting effects. The tutorial is built into the game with help cards that explain each game concepts when accessing them for the first time. The milestone-unlocking is specifically meant to introduce newcomers to new gaming concepts gradually, while also allowing veterans to focus on the important aspects of a city and somewhat keep some realism over what a mayor can do (since approval and elections aren’t a factor). A much as I would like to build a subway system or a nuclear power plant in my 500-citizen village, it totally makes sense that I can't and should instead focus on making sure they have access to drinkable water (which also means that water being pumped in shouldn't be downstream from where my sewage is being pumped-out!).
It's hard to forget Colossal Order's experience with Cities in Motion! Transportation is at the forefront of city planning and expansion. You have dozens of types of roads: streets, boulevards, highways, some with one, two, three, even four lanes! Or perhaps some of those lanes are reserves for buses, or for bikes? Public transport is offered in a huge variety of flavors, and while some or redundant and you won't need them all, the fact is that they offer the option. Do you want the freedom and simplicity of city buses? Maybe the extra carrying capacity of trams is more to your liking? Perhaps an overhead monorail to free up the streets? How about those ferries to carry your folks across the river or along your canals? Cable cars will get you up those hills and mountains hassle-free! I'm barely scratching the service and skipping intercity transports for passengers, tourists, and the import or export of goods and raw material.
☹ What bothered me ☹
While innovative on release, the agent-based system feels pretty primitive by today's standards. Cars all attempt to travel using the shortest route possible, ignoring any concept of traffic. What's the point of building a four-lane highway when all the cars will pile up in the left and right lanes to make it to their exit, regardless of how many ways there are to travel around that specific out ramp? You may build a nice, convenient, high-speed highway around your city, but people might just drive across the low-speed residential streets with dozens of intersections because it's the most direct route. You might have miles-long lines of cars and trucks, preventing emergency services from ever making it on the site of a crime or a fire. Any service you can't plan routes for, such as garbage trucks or hearses, will fill up within the next few streets, never making it to the rest of the city, no matter whether they are well within coverage distance.
Zoning and constructible areas are limited to square tiles, but the layout of those tiles are tied to the streets. If you build nice, curved roads in your city, these tiles will be spread irregularly, so you can forget any forme of building density, and forego having 4x4 houses unless the streets are perfectly straight. This is something even SimCity 2013 knew to address, having its tiles compress or stretch along the road curves to make sure plots of lands weren't separated and made inefficient. Also, except for pre-built buildings, you cannot choose which street a zoned area's building will be facing. I dread building houses and stores on corners, as they will often face the wrong street than the one I intended. Terrain height is also mismanaged, a building defaulting at the height of the street they are facing, while its parking space might get painted on a curved cliff to its side. There are a lot of small, minute details such as this that can get very irritating.
Verdict: ★★★★★ - "Play this. Now."
Don't get fooled by the negatives, because Cities: Skylines is the best, more complex and more complete city builder out there. Sure, its sequel is on its way and addresses some of the issues, but it will still have a long way to go to be packed with as much content as this game has had with all of its bite-sized DLCs released through years of development. Unless you just don't like city builders, I don't understand how anyone would want to skip this one!

Better than Cities Skylines 2
Posted: June 19, 2021
Built a town next to a river. Said town started to overflow with sewage and kill off half my population. It's a great game.
Posted: June 27, 2022
Spent hours making a city
made huge infrastructures all around and invoked my own policies
I flooded my city in a matter of seconds by accidentally making a dam that covered my city in poo water
10/10 would waste my freetime again.

This is THE city builder. For anyone who has been a fan of SimCity at some point, you will be pleasantly surprised by the amount of customization of ALL aspects in this game. Perfect to play with your favorite podcast in the background in a dimly lit room I'm so lonely
Posted: March 21, 2015
This game is comparable to Simcity 4 but with better graphics and gameplay. A whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and DRM.
Pros:
- Realistic water simulation; if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river, you're gonna feed your citizens with poop water. And dams will alter the flow of the river
- Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.).
- District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.
- Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.
- Natural resource exploitation for more income.
- Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.
- Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.
- You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.
- Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.
- Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)
Cons:
- Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted. This kinda irritate the OCD side of me.
- The unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on. And you might have to sacrifice a couple of houses to accomodate the buildings.
I will continue to update my review as I put more hours into this game. Feel free to comment on your opinions.

Hi guys! This is Pablo, from SimNation.
Cities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.
Simulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes.
Traffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.
The economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.
Building a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.
Despite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.
If you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase. A game that will most likely be supported for years, with an insanely amount of Mods and great deal of free patches to come, which will hopefully fix those rough edges from day 1.

Cities Skylines looks to bring back the classic city building genre to it's roots. Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.
And while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game. You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.
The UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the "best" city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn't overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies. For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.
Planning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn't surprsing given the developer's history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn't part of the Cities XL series).
Graphics look good for the genre (don't expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you'd expect, nothing really stands out, and it's not annoying, fairly average.
While the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I'm sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I'm sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn't mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.
PS:
Kill Chirpy.

The Good
Traffic is a fun dilemma to deal with
Each citizen of your town is accounted for throughout their entire lives
Your involvement with the city is great from start to finish as you manage every major aspect of your citizens lives
Left-lane traffic is a fun aspect I'd never considered before playing (as an American)
Incredibly replayable
Tons of awesome workshop mods
The Bad
Traffic is a dilemma to deal with
The game almost needs some mods to feel more complete
DLC is kind of expensive for what it is
Bottom Line
8/10 Cities: Skylines is definitely the best city-builder game I have ever played but not without flaws, this game falls into a familiar routine of there being few optimal ways to run a town. The depth of this game is like no other city-builder though, it's just great, from following each citizen about their daily routine to using mods to take away all stoplights allowing your citizens to drive with reckless abondon this game definitely has many hours of gameplay to offer the casual gamer. I highly recommend grabbing this game, especially on sale.

I'm a former Sim City Dlx player and a senior citizen. Cities:Skylines is a challenging and interesting game.

Has to be one of my more favorite games to create with. The mod community is amazing.

Saw this game on the front page, never knew about it.
As of writing this review, I've only played for six hours and I've already restarted four times because the streets weren't straight enough and I went into debt rebuilding them.
PROS:
No EA.
No EA Origin.
Did I mention no EA involved?
Also no EA.
-New land purchasing now gives players a choice of when and where to expand, not just confining them to a small square of limited development.
-Road tools give players much more freedom to create and weave around the city, upgrading also made easy as well. (Simcity 2013's upgrade roads had an idea going but you had to level an entire street to get anywhere, completely negating the point)
-Being able to relocate a civil building for much cheaper than destroying removes the hassle of trying to redo roads around a public service due to a single building.
-Still has well-working fluid and sewage dynamics, taking what SimCity 5 attempted with their pollution system and actually turning it into something good.
-Parks affect the lives of citizens without taking ungodly amounts of space, and much like a real park one large park that is easily accessible more than a few hundred small parks all around the city wasting space. (cough cough SimCity 2013)
-Even though the water dynamics are a little rough as of right now, the game still gives an option for a hydroelectric dam; a feat previously impossible in SimCity 2013 and unimaginably difficult in SimCity 4.
The only thing I don't like about this game so far?
@Developers #The #twitter-like #announcements #and #the #constant #usage #of #hashtags (I get the point but I feel like my city is composed of preteens.)
So far and still hours later, 10/10.
**EDIT 5/23/2015**
I've found that the developers of the game themselves are very active and receptive in their own community at r/citiesskylines and actually listen to their users.
Developers also cranked out FREE and well-done DLC, like it's supposed to be.
Game still kicks ass!

What. A. Game.
If you were like me and, after hearing the negativity around SimCity 2013, and played the early SimCities with glee, then it is likely you were hunting out a modern city builder with serious credentials. Cities: Skylines is just that.
Before I talk about Pros and Cons, I will just say this game gets a solid 8.5/10 and despite a pretty stiff £22 asking price, is worth every penny.
PROS
Detailed and involving tax and economy features
Variety of buildings and themes
All major aspects of city builders and of just real life are covered: health, crime, traffic, fire etc.
Good road building mechanics
Water-based buildings that CAN ACTUALLY BE PLACED (ahem SimCity 2004 ahem)
Lovely graphics
Efficient and effective interface
Slow paced, relaxing gameplay
Traffic that actually requires thought and effort
Good learning curve
Mod support
CONS
Screw you, bus line creator
Rivers can flood through terrain, ruining cities you once though safe from water damage
Beach?
Some mods seem for me to not work, though whether this is C:S's or the modder's fault I'm not sure
Sometimes, placing of large buildings like the largest hospital, is tricky as it complains stuff is in the way when it isn't (UPDATE - have realised that this may partially be down to the underground power cables mod i have getting in the way of building, Anarchy mod fixes this)
Overall, a great game and a definite recommedation.

The vanilla version of this game is a decent city management simulator.
A heavily modded version of this game is simply the best digital diorama / landscape simulator available.
It's kind of stupid how many hours of my life this game has sucked away.
Posted: March 16, 2015
I like this.
Pros:
+No EA.
+Good performance.
+No "Always online" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
+Mod support.
+Launch price is like 50-60% of normal full game price on launch.
+Game takes up little HardDrive space (About 2-4 GB's).
+Large build space (Composed of 2x2Km squares that can be unlocked, I have 8 at the moment, not sure of limit). (+mods to increase it further, at cost of performance)
+A few unique mechanics (Like Districts), as well as good mechanics you'd expect.
Cons:
-Easy.
-Lack of endgame content.
-Looks like a Sim City clone. (Yet the "clone" is >2 times better...)
TL;DR: Good. Get.

This game has fascinated me since its early days back in 2015. In a challenging way, it offers countless ways to build and manage your cities and is tremendously fun!
What makes this game so unique? The community, whose expansions keep the game alive in a sensational way!
🕹️The main game:
🧭You quickly get into the game and learn many useful things to create a nice looking scene in a short time. The difficult thing is to keep the city going.

Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master.
⚖️Finding the right balance between important areas like education, public safety, health care, firefighting, water supply, electricity, economy and much more is definitely not easy. And the more the city grows, the more difficult it becomes to master these things.
🚦In addition, there is the complex traffic simulation, which also needs to be closely monitored.
For example, you can spend several hours designing and building a working highway exit. After a while, after you have expanded your city, built a new district, recruited more inhabitants, got the economy going, the exit you built does not work as it should, usually it just makes things worse and a newer, better solution is needed.
💡This concept from the example above also applies to the other areas of the game.
What sounds frustrating at first is a real blessing for the game. It is motivating, challenges you and your thinking, and makes it hard to stop playing.
💭I hope you understand what I am trying to say: You have so many possibilities and when you think you have finally done something right, it is disproved in the next moment and that's what makes the game so exciting and challenging.
🧩Expansions:
🔋Many games also develop so-called DLCs, which are usually intended to expand the players' experience. This is what the developers of "CS" do very well and have also really convinced the one or other time. Some of the expansions really stand out, others can be bought for a small pleasure, but are not really must-haves.
🔎Here is just a brief overview and recommendation (more detailed information would require a separate review):
Name	X	Do I need this? (my opinion)
💡After Dark (AD)	🟢	Should be already included in the default game!
❄️Snowfall	🟡	Do you like extra challenges and snow? Then yes! Do you want trams in your game? Then a double yes!
☄️Natural Disasters	🟠	It can be fun from time to time to destroy your city in different ways, but in the long run you'd rather disable these features. I like it quite well because of the helicopter extension!
🚧Mass Transit	🟢	The first popular expansion for the game! This DLC will definitely help you and make it easier for you to better manage traffic situations in your city. There are also some really cool means of transport!
♻️Green Cities	🟠	In times like these an important topic for many people: environmental awareness. Green Cities adds some nice eco-friendly options and assets to the game!
🎢Parklife	🟡	The game lacked something like this in every aspect! It almost makes you think you are playing another game e.g. Planet Zoo.
🏭Industries	🟢	The next great great update for the game: Industries. It expands the economic aspect in a huge way and is definitely worth the purchase. Creating and controlling supply chains makes the industry even more difficult and challenging. I like!
📚Campus	🟢	Similarly great DLC as "Industries", but for the educational aspect. Beautiful assets and outstandingly good functions that bring a new challenge into the game again. Here you can see clearly that the developers have found the right path towards the community!
🎣Sunset Harbor	🟢	The current DLC has surpassed itself. Not only because the free update brings many good options, but also the diversity. A new industrial sector: fishing, other means of transport and much more. Nice to have!
➕Other	🔴	There are further small DLC packages (some for free!), radio channels and so-called Content Creator Packs.
💰Sounds too good to be true? Well, the DLCs and other little expansions have their price...
If you add it all up, you'll easily get over 200 Euros. Whether this economic strategy is good and ethically correct is not for me to decide, I know too little about it.
But the good side: The purchases are of course optional and the important in-game changes come for free with the updates!
📢By the way, it comes with 9 different languages and thus also expands the fantastic community.

German 🥨
French 🥖
Spanisch 💃

💪The Game Changer (Mods & More)
👀As you have seen, this game already has a lot to offer. But the incredible thing is that there is even more: the steam workshop and its community!
⚙️Anyone who is familiar with programming can create mods for Cities Skylines and share them with anyone who owns the game. And WOW, some people would have done better as developers at Colossal Order. These players, who programmed mods in their spare time, have created real game changers. Actually, I don't even want to play the game without such mods anymore, because they bring awesome additional features.
🛠Besides mods, there are also assets that can also be created and provided by anyone. And WOW 2.0, there are some really unbelievable nice looking buildings, props, vehicles, streets, save games, maps, color corrections and much much more...
📜In summary, this is the recipe of Cities' success and why the game is still very popular after almost 6 years. Constant development, new things, new features, for all areas and ideas. And if something is missing, create it yourself!
9/10✔️
Colossal Order has definitely created a masterpiece for us, which thanks to its community has been played by many happy gamers since 2015 and will surely remain so for a few years to come.

This is the game awaited by the city building community for 12 years, a proper, full 3D successor to SimCity 4. It is incredibly fun, insanely addictive and somewhat challenging, although it has some minor drawbacks.
Pros:
+ It is so addictive I spent 36 hours playing it in the first three days after I got it
+ Transportation system is very detailed, and agent-based simulation works very nicely with it
+ Zoning works very nicely with free-form roads
+ The available territory is quite big - up to 36 square kilometers in base game (9 tiles), up to 100 square kilometers with a simple mod (25 tiles) and whopping 324 (!) square kilometers with the less stable 81 tile enabler
+ Unique and fully working fluid dynamics system
+ Districts and policies allow for fine control over your city
+ Globally unlocked buildings help to vary playstyle in different cities - from building an eco-friendly utopia with lots of parks and low taxes to an industrial hellhole full of illness and crime
+ Modding is quite encouraged - the community is very active and the tools are easy to use; by now there are hundreds of great mods and assets avalable on the Workshop
+ Dev team keeps in touch with the community and pays a lot of attention to the feedback
+ Free patches significantly improve the game, introducing great features like tunnels, European themed buildings, day-night cycle, in-game terraforming, canals and quays, increased object limits and improved mod tools
Cons:
- It's not very challenging past the first 10k - the biggest hurdles left are traffic and congestion (there are numerous mods rebalancing the game to be harder more realistic, but I can't vouch for their quality)
- The amount of assets included in the base game is relatively small (but bigger than on release), so you'll see a lot of repetition (although it is remedied by mods and community-created assets, you have to keep an eye on RAM and VRAM consumption)
- Day/night cycle doesn't really make much of a difference in vanilla gameplay (again, there's an excellent mod which overhauls the mechanic - Rush Hour)
All in all, Cities: Skylines is an amazing game that's certainly worth a purchase, especially with its low price. But you may not enjoy it as much if you are not a fan of the genre.

Become a traffic snob. Bore your friends about infrastructure design. Highjack local authority meetings with your informed opinion about road layouts.
This game is a time vampire. Once purchased, many hours of your life will be spent building the perfect roundabout, locating industrial zones and trying to make residential areas rich.
This is your opportunity to be god, or the next best thing, a local authority member.

It's like Cities Skylines 2, except doesn't run at 15 FPS.

This is what Sim City should have been...

i built a city and it burnt down
Posted: November 10, 2023
More than 1 FPS, so better than Skylines 2
Posted: December 10, 2020
step by step gameplay tutorial:
1) try to build a beautiful city >> it's semi-beautiful at best and ur traffic sucks
2) ignore the problems and continue until ur city is in flames
3) try to fix the city
4) cry and start a new city
5) forget about a nice looking city, build a working city
6) fail
7) watch some dude build pretty and 100% working cities on YouTube
8) cry, download some mods and attempt again

I started with city builders way back in 1996, with SimCity 2000, beginning the construction of my "capital of capitals" - I was nine, I nerded out, made it a capital of an empire I created for myself, heh. For the permanently angled view, the constant reticulation of splines, and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result, there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild. SC3K (and 3K Unlimited/World Edition) was the same basic idea with a lot more detail, and SC4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger (Rush Hour was a neat touch too, because you could actually into the streets - not quite like Streets of SimCity, but close enough). Even Societies, which gets a bad rap because it's not Maxis - among other reasons - worked out great - perhaps even better, as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely. (I tended to build Authoritarian cities, heh heh.)
Then came SimCity 2013, and it seemed like a good idea to start. Except for the constant online feature, the DRM controversies, so on...and the fact that the city sizes were fixed, as opposed to the variously-sized tiles made available in SC4. It basically turned into another typical EA game - "buy more of this, it will enhance the experience". I was disappointed...Cities of Tomorrow was an interesting touch, but not enough to keep me going.
Then I heard about Cities: Skylines. A number of people suggested the similar-yet-unrelated Cities XL (and various sequels) to me in lieu of SC '13, and when this came out, some pointed me here. I got it during the last sale about a month ago, and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitals...and for the first time in twenty years, it felt like a real city, with real needs. I was used to the basic stuff, mainstays of most city-builders of this type - needs power, water, garbage disposal, police, so on - but in my first playthrough, I looked in the healthcare tab and went, "Wait...cemeteries? You have DEATHCARE in this game?" Which was kinda funny to me, as in real life, I like to explore historic cemeteries...the thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities!
The unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch, because they're functional as well as decorative (I have them all except for the fusion plant, I need the observatory). The weather is also nice; I will have to get the Snowfall pack to see how well I can build in the snow...if it's anything like New England winter, probably not too well!
While there is still a size limit (barring the use of mods) for your city, it's a lot larger than in SC '13, and also has a lot more flexibility than SC '13...or any other type of game like this I've played, for that matter. And the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family; my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city.
In short: Loads of fun, and it's induced me to commit heresy against the Church of SimCity by building here...any fans of the golden oldies, please don't burn me at the stake.

Developer relies too much on modding community, countless features that should be already part of base game have to be integrated via mods.
It would be fine if the developer wasnt asking 247€ for the whole package of DLCs.
