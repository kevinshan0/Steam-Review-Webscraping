EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I've already played this game for over 40 hours and I've loved every minute of it! (except for the crashing early on). So, here's my review for T.A.B.S.
The Good
So far, the good outweighs the bad massively, some of the good things include:
Maps
Units
Physics/AI
Costumes
Funny Bugs
Maps
The maps are so detailed, my favourite map so far is the Ancient Sandbox map, the map is huge and every little thing is detailed, from water, to windows, to ancient monuments. Every map has a unique personality to it such as hiding little secrets (looking at you, tribal maps). The maps in this game are far better than the maps showcased in earlier versions.
9.5/10
Units
There are so many units in this version of T.A.B.S, each unit has a different weapon and costume, the amount of detail put into each unit is absurd. The units in this game are far better than previous versions as they now have more than just a helmet and the sound of the units is amazing.
9/10
Physics/AI
The physics and AI in this game are so much more advanced than any other game, the alpha versions had units just lunge at each other and friendly fire, now units actually wind up, fall over, try to miss hitting their teammates and work together. The AI is a bit buggy at times but it is understandable for such a physics based game.
8.5/10
Costumes
Holy crap the costumes have improved so much since the older versions, great work to everyone working on them! I'm surprised how well the costumes stick to the unit and do not clip. The uniforms are so detailed, even the weapons look great. Some weapons have a few scratches that makes them look as if they have been used before, I love these tiny details, they give the game and the units a lot more personality and help them fit in with the style of this game.
9.9/10
Secrets, Unit Creator, New Factions
This is an update to the review, the unit creator and new factions are absolutely amazing, the amount of detail put into each new unit is incredible, every unit has its own quirks and its weapons and clothing can be found in the unit creator to be used on other units. I love the new secret units as well as you have to go on a fun scavenger hunt around the map to find these new units.
10/10
Funny Bugs
Most people would consider bugs a negative, but the bugs in this game work perfectly, they fit in with the games wackiness and they are just plain amazing, sometimes units freak out and die right before they attack another unit, and sometimes units are stuck off the edges of cliffs and other units come and push them off. The bugs in this game are absolutely hillairious and I wouldn't patch them even if I knew how!
10/10
The Bad
Honestly, there isn't much to talk about in this category, the only things that pop up are minor details, so lets get into it!
Lag
Hit Detection in Slow Motion
Lag
Occasionally, the game will lag if you decide to create a large scale battle, this is a very minor issue though and doesn't really interfere with gameplay as it only really affects sandbox mode.
Slow Motion Hit Detection
When in slow motion, hits sometimes wont register properly, leaving enemy units alive, once again it's only a small issue and doesn't really affect gameplay unless you are in sandbox mode using slow motion to stop the lag from huge battles. EDIT. The hit detection has been fixed. meaning that this is no longer a con of the game.
Conclusion
Overall, T.A.B.S is my personal favourite game of all time and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future, there are a few bugs but most of them give the game personality and add to its wackiness, I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for great games on steam. If I had to rate it out of 10, I'd give it:
11/10
Thanks for reading this review, hope it helps you!

My dad is an avid gamer with a huge steam library. He gave me my first PC and my taste in games and he is what made me end up in a well-paid IT job. In my entire life have I not seen my dad laugh as hard (he was in tears, almost choking and red-faced) as when we played this. We have since beaten almost all the content in the game on his account together and we loved every minute of it.
Thank you so much Landfall for the quality time with my dad.

I don't play this game myself. Just not my cup of tea. So at the time of this review, why do I have 240+ hours on it?
Well, my 7 year old son plays it, and has been playing it since he was 5. Granted, some of that time is just him leaving it running because the kid is just simply incapable of closing a program when he's done with it, but he loves this game. He's constantly setting up battles (often requesting I come in and try to beat an army he made). When they added Unit Creator, he lost his mind. He's probably created like 200 units of his own. They're all ridiculously overpowered compared to normal units, but he loves it, and I love that he loves it.
If you're an adult, you might get a few hours of fun out of the silliness of the game, and then you'll be done with it. If you have a kid that likes watching imaginary troops do battle, and building their own troops with crazy powers and whatnot, this is well worth the price of admission and the bonding time you'll have as a result.

I bought this game the day early access came out. I've been playing it for quite some time, so I should hopefully know what I'm talking about in this review. Firstly, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, (TABS) as the name suggests is a battle simulator. It's enjoyable, and you can sink hours and hours into this game, at first. I'll start with what I find great about this game.
-Physics ; They can be extremely wonky and hilarious at times
-Units ; as of writing this the game includes around 140 pre-made units.
-Unit Creator ; Being able to make your own units is amazing, and honestly, i sunk at least 50 hours doing this alone.
-User-made content ; Players can create their own campaigns, units, and then share them with the community.
-The Developers ; While this isn't necessarily the game, these are some of the best developers I have seen when it comes to how they interact with their fanbase. Landfall is extremely friendly, and they listen to the community as well.
-Community ; Also not exactly the game, but the community is great! They're welcoming, and enjoy sharing their views.
-Maps ; Some of the maps in this game are great. The newer maps that were released such as Fantasy Evil / Good look appealing.
-Campaign ; While I don't play the campaign that often, it can be enjoyable.
-Controlling Units ; Being able to control units, while wonky, is still fun.
Now to move on to a few things that I have some issues with. This is completely my opinion. (Also, I didn't mention multiplayer anywhere in this review since I haven't tested it as of writing)
-Playtime ; Depending on your attention span, as well as if you enjoy the game or not, you may get somewhat bored after the 20 hour mark. Of course, this game isn't exactly meant to be played for 4 hours straight, but more of a "I'll play for half an hour" kind of game.
-Performance ; This game's performance can vary quite heavily. Not from graphics, but units. Since this game is heavy with physics, you can expect performance to drop, although this is partially my fault, as I don't have that great of a computer.
All in all, I'd say for twenty dollars, this game is worth it. It depends on a few things you find interest in, but overall, it's a solid game. Not only this, but the game is still going to get some content post-release, such as the hero unit, as well as possibly some more units. I believe this is a good game that you might want to check out.

Once the custom unit creation is finished, this is undoubtedly the best battle simulator ever... by a long shot.
Oh, and it's hilarious.
Yep, that's it. That's all you need to know.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
SOOOO.... here's my review for TABS.
I've been waiting since 2016 for it and kind of lost interest, however when I went on YT yesterday and found "Fully released TABS gameplay" in my recommended I came directly here and bought it without skipping a heartbeat. Now, for the record, I'm a little disappointed, however I'll get to that later. Let's start with the good parts.
CAMPAIGN:
Highly expanded campaign since the betas. Tonnes of levels to play, and three different difficulties. The game already had a campaign, but it was rather short and needed work. This new campaign has exceeded expectations. Well done LandFall!
MAPS:
Lots of new maps to play, and not just the same map reskinned! (For example the Ancient2 map which includes buildings) This allows for new variations and strategies to be developed, as well as exciting scenarios. The maps also just look great in general.
UNIT COSTUMES:
Finally the units actually have more than their helmet! A very good job on the unit's outfits, and it really adds another layer of realism to the game. (Desperately needed) Overall, the outfits were done extremely well, and I highly appreciate them.
INTERFACE:
A nice, smooth interface for the new TABS.
Now on to the negatives. (Yes, you may have noticed I haven't covered the new units but I will get to that later)
CRASHING:
The game crashes every now and then, although this is to be expected for Early Access games.
NO HELP:
For new players, there is no help for controls. Although basic controls are rather easy to get a hang of, more 'advanced' controls such as 'f' for fly-around camera (before match starts) and slow-mo controls (left-click and g) are not pointed out to you. Maybe a basic tutorial might help here?
SUPERLAG:
Super laggy when doing a large-scale battle, only not laggy if you have it constantly on slow-motion.
Now onto my biggest dislike/positive. NEW UNITS!!
NEW UNITS:
So there are tonnes of new units added (such as the entire cavemen faction) but there were also tonnes of units taken out. Some personal favourites include:
- Ninjas and Grand Master Ninjas
- Samurais
- Super and Dark Peasants
- Muskets
- Whole entire Neon faction
Now where did these all go??
I hope they come back again, but it was kind of a disappointment when I first opened the game and realised they weren't there. Also other units showcased in videos upcoming to the full release weren't released either. Some of these I was also really looking forward to messing around with, such as the Flamethrower and DaVinci Tank.
I understand that some things won't make the cut, but...
In conclusion there are multiple negatives to the game, however there is many positive aspects as well. I hope in the coming updates that these units will be added and the crash bug fixed. My final rating is 7/10.

If I had this game when I was 11, there's no way I'd ever have left the computer
It is the game for everyone who liked to set up toy soldiers and create imaginary stories and battles
There are many great things going for this game:
-Good unit designs with a lot of factions, prehistoric to wild west
-Hilarious vocal acting
-Very funny physics
-Friggin Slo-Mo
However, the absolute greatest thing in the game (imo) is the unit creator; when it first came out, it was impossible to stop making unit after unit, just so many possibilities. There are a lot of props for unadded factions in the UC, so you can create those factions too!
One criticism is that the campaign is often a campain to get through, as some battles need a fluke or plain luck to win. Also there is a range of bugs, and the unit creator is unpolished (though it could be getting updates later)
However this is one game I don't get tired of. One of the funniest games I've ever played
Posted: May 19, 2021
When I was younger (back in 2016 I think?) I had seen videos of people playing the original TABS and I instantly loved it. I had always wanted to get the game but I had never known how. So, when this new version of TABS came out (early alpha?), I was old enough to figure out how to finally get the game. I remember that I had gone to Target and bought a Steam gift card (it was the only way I knew how to buy the game at the time) and downloaded Steam for the single purpose of getting TABS. Now, over a year and four months later, I have gotten some other games on Steam but TABS has always been my absolute favorite and is the single most played game which I own, with that time being over 300 hours. What can I say? I just really like the game. To anyone who reads this and doesn't own the game, I recommend that you at least watch some youtubers play TABS first and see whether or not the game is your cup of tea. If it is, then I sincerely hope you enjoy the game as much as I do, and have fun!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
[DISCLAIMER]: Please keep in mind that TABS is still in development and gameplay is subject to change.
One of the most revolutionizing games of 2020, TABS achieves something that no other game can ever dream of. The sheer volume of accuracy the battles players create in this game are so immense, that not even the units themselves can keep their eyes from boggling around, thinking about how much effort went into making a game such a masterpiece, to the point where their bodies dance as they are flung into the air, as if they are floating on clouds of totality and accuracy. Landfall has achieved something that a mortal mind cannot bear to imagine, as the amount of knowledge received from this game will instantaneously both crush and explode your brain until your mortal self will evaporate from existence, and into the heavens where you will look down upon the feeble bodies of mortality and laugh at those who will never stride to play this game and achieve godly power.
[SERIOUS REVIEW]: The game is great. That is all I can say. Although there are still numerous bugs within the game itself the developers are working hard to stomp these little annoyances out, so thank you devs :)
Some upsides of this game would be the variety in unit styles and weapons. Another upside would be the amount of work dedicated to the updates. Although these come at a slow rate, they are always rewarding in the end. If you want more of a treat, and this is for some detectives out there on steam, you can always search for secret units that add spice to a battle. Also the way some units are generated are hilarious. One will be a cyclops and the other will have 8 eyes!
Some downsides would be the amount of bugs and the replay-ability of this game. As stated above the bugs are being worked on but they will appear and ruin the game for you, which is not for the faint of heart. After a handful of games you may get bored, which is what the secret units are for. But once you obtain all these secret units, there really isn't much to play with afterwards.
Overall promising game with a few annoyances, but overall great!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game started out as a silly sandbox army game that had some fun elements for someone looking for a fun little game. But now it has evolved into something that can interest players of many interests. There are dozens of diverse, silly, and crazy units that are entertaining to watch alone. Some levels can be seriously difficult and require strategy, providing the player with little resources, or restricting available units. The ability to control units adds a whole array of possible level designs and lets the player witness the chaos amongst their army. Creating and sharing your own levels and campaigns is easy and adds a constant supply of new unique levels. All in all, I am very impressed with how well this game has grown and look forward to future updates. :)

Posted: April 11, 2022
Ok this is a honest review on the 120+ hours i had on this game
THE GAME:
The game is a battle sort of combat area where there is a blue and a red team and you must pick the right units to beat the other ones or just see which units are better then the other units,
There's a CAMPAIGN mode,
you have a limited amount of coins to spend to beat the other units on the other side which while playing the game its challenging and you must find different ways to beat your opponents and if you beat all the levels in the campaign you have of course beaten the campaign you have chosen but its not the only campaign so you can keep on beating all of them or EVEN beat every campaign without being defeated once or just leave the campaign bit alone you can also download Custom campaigns.
There's MULTIPLAYER,
i haven't played much of multiplayer but this is what you can do in the mode.
there's 3 sections LOCAL, FRIENDS AND QUICK MATCH.
Local is there you plug in a other controller i think and your friend and you get to pick a team and both of you duel it out to see who has the better team,
Friends is where you get to fight your friends and duel it out thought online,
And quick match is where you go online and fight a random person with a team and they also pick a team.
The WORKSHOP,
is where you can find lots of creations from other fellow so called ' Gamer's ' and see what they have made
what you can find in the work shop is sections you can pick from what you want to download with concludes,
Battles, Campaign, Units and Factions.
You can put filters on the stuff you want to download which is Popularity, Newest, Rating and Subscribes which is in the category section for filters and i would suggest picking in the timeline section of filters all time because you won't find anything else if you pick Today, This week and this month,
There's tags what you can pick from in filters which are Challenging, Historical, Humor, Pop culture, Other and my favourite on POWERFUL!!
You can also upload your own work you have spent time on for others to download.
CUSTOM CONTENT,
in my opinion in my favourite mode is custom content because you get to create your own ideas which are of course
Battle, Campaign, Units and factions,
i'm going to talk about Units and factions,
Unites are so SO SO fun to make, you can make them Super Powerful you can base them of a character you like in anything or just find out how to mess up the game even more with a glitched character what can one shot anything.
Factions is where you can put your broken and op characters in like a group so you can take them out on the battle field.
There also SECRET UNITS,
how to get secret units is across most of the maps you can find weird objects and stare at them for like 6 seconds and you might get a unit,
there's 54 units so you can just them your self which is very very hard or just look it up on Youtube.
MY TAKE ON THE GAME:
from the hours and hours i have played on this game was amazing i loved everything from it but one thing which ill explain later in this review,
i found the workshop amazing seeing what people have created and seeing if they have a more op character then mine if they do fixing mine.
i looked finding all the secrets units and messing around!
the only problem i have with this game thought is the achievements,
if you want to enjoy this game and mess around doing so do NOT and i repeat do NOT do the achievements
some of these achievements by looking at them might be easy but there not there dreadful.
and for the people who want to do all the achievements i have found out a way to beat all the campaigns without being defeated once and its pretty easy but i might put it on Youtube but i going to try and hit a goal of 10 subs not much but if i do ill reveal the glitch.
i think if your thinking of getting this game then get it because you will enjoy it.
last thing up vote this post please this took 1 hour of my time and i hoped you enjoyed it.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The year is 336 BC. You are a shield bearer in a phalanx formation, shoulder to shoulder with fellow shield bearers and backed up by the mighty spears of the sarissas, which are poking out in front of you. Another phalanx is several meters in front of yours, taking point. You are pushing into the next town on the last legs of a long and weary campaign. You're a seasoned veteran shield bearer. Your mates trust you with their lives. That thin piece of wood you're holding is the only thing standing between glory and shame, victory and defeat, life and death.
Up ahead, you hear the second phalanx start to engage with the enemy. The utter silence has broken out into battle cries and screams of panic. "Are we winning?" you think to yourself. After all, you can't see anything.
More shouting and panic abounds. You look up from your shield, but immediately wish you hadn't. High above your head, the bodies of were once the first phalanx division are punctured by countless arrows, being held in unnatural positions and steadily floating upwards, with what appears to be...
"BALLOONS...?!"
Before you can react, you feel several thunks of arrows hitting your shield, their arrowheads slightly poking through the other side. You hear several loud hissing noises. Something is pulling up on your shield! Wait... Could it be? No way.
You feel your feet come off the ground. You're hanging onto your shield now for dear life, knowing that letting go will mean falling to your death.
You look around in utter panic to see your fellow shield bearers being lifted in the air by arrows that are tied with balloons. Screams echo around you. You look down and see the sarissas have all been killed, their bodies punctured with arrows and floating upwards. The broken corpses of the first phalanx lay on the ground in front of your target... a bunch of giggling archers in funny clothing - the likes of which design seems ridiculous, yet fashionable. You've never seen such attire within all of the cities you've conquered thus far.
The archers prepare another volley.
"Oh, Gods..."
It's too late. More arrows fly. Many of them miss, but... one pierces your leg! Hopeless, you cry out in pain, and more hissing ensues as the balloon inflates. But the worst is yet to come - the laws of physics are a cruel mistress. The strings detach in your shield! Now off-balance, the arrow in your leg yanks you upward into a spin, hanging you upside-down! Your thoughts blur as your balance diminishes and the blood rushes to your head. Discombobulation and pain are the only two feelings you can comprehend.
Of course, what goes up eventually must come down. Suddenly, you feel the balloon detach from the arrow in your leg. You look up in horror to see that the helium-powered forces which were holding you in high the air are now flying way above your head. Gravity pulls you downward so fast that your stomach jumps into your throat. You're in free fall!
There's only one thing that happens next... and perhaps, right now, a swift end to this madness is just a blessing.
You close your eyes and brace for impact.

10/10: TABS is the most quirky battle simulation game I've ever had the great pleasure of playing. It has wonky physics, hilarious situations, great and funny audio design, wide variety of units, and - perhaps best of all, as exemplified in this review - the sheer and utter chaos!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Just the most wackiest and most hilarious battle simulator out in the market.
Now you may have already scrolled past dozens of reviews like this to find mine talking about detailed maps, diverse units, hilarious combat system and somewhat short campaign as well as maybe the level workshop a smidge, as well as the new unit creator which is still in beta and a hell of a lot of fun. (Trust me when I say making Santa the dual-wielding fish maniac who impales units with magical spears and summoning boulders onto his enemies is the best.)
Instead, I'll talk about why this game takes such a special place in my heart.
Couple years ago, a game called Totally Accurate Battle Simulator releases, with wacky ragdoll physics , explosive combat and stupidly silly battles, it took the internet by storm. I have been playing this game since it has been in it's open alphas and watched the closed betas on YT for hours on end. I watched it grow from the silly lunge-yourself-at-enemy combat mechanics, weird dialogue and the fact most of the time their only clothing piece were usually helmets to over the top combat systems which are still silly, somehow weirder dialogue and way way more detailed clothing.
Remember this is all harking back from a small prototype game from a small indie game studio which was only known for Clustertruck called Landfall. They werent some bigshot company like Ubisoft or used stuff like Unreal Engine. No, they pulled together a Unity Project and made something stupid.
This is why this game takes a special place in my heart. From humble beginnings to this stage of the game.
It's not even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ finished yet. All I can say is whilst the price is still half of when it comes out of Early Access, buy it. You won't regret it.
P.S. People seem to like him a lot and one guy requested I do it so here it is; I have uploaded my aformentioned Santa Claus to the Workshop! Search for Santa Claus (Steam Review) and you should get it! Enjoy!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
SOOOO.... here's my review for TABS!
I've been waiting since 2016 for it and kind of lost interest, however when I went on YT and I found "Fully released TABS gameplay" in my recommended I came directly here and bought it without skipping a heartbeat. Now, for the record, I'm a little disappointed, however I'll get to that later. Let's start with the good parts.
Improved Slow Motion:
On the alpha version, There are none of the slow motion sounds at all, But this release on steam does have! And i love it!
CAMPAIGN:
Highly expanded campaign since the alphas. Tonnes of levels to play, and three different difficulties. The game already had a campaign, but it was rather short and needed work. This new campaign has exceeded expectations. Well done LandFall!
MAPS:
Lots of new maps to play, and not just the same map reskinned! (For example the Ancient2 map which includes buildings) This allows for new variations and strategies to be developed, as well as exciting scenarios. The maps also just look great in general.
UNIT COSTUMES:
Finally the units actually have more than their helmet! A very good job on the unit's outfits, and it really adds another layer of realism to the game. (Desperately needed) Overall, the outfits were done extremely well, and I highly appreciate them.
INTERFACE:
A nice, smooth interface for the new TABS. And i love it!
Now on to the negatives. (Yes, you may have noticed I haven't covered the new units but I will get to that later)
CRASHING:
The game crashes every now and then, although this is to be expected for Early Access games.
NO HELP:
For new players, there is no help for controls. Although basic controls are rather easy to get a hang of, more 'advanced' controls such as 'f' for fly-around camera (before match starts) and slow-mo controls (left-click and g) are not pointed out to you. Maybe a basic tutorial might help here?
SUPERLAG:
Super laggy when doing a large-scale battle, only not laggy if you have it constantly on slow-motion.
Now onto my biggest dislike/positive. NEW UNITS!!
NEW UNITS:
So there are tonnes of new units added (such as the entire cavemen faction) but there were also tonnes of units taken out. Some personal favourites include:
- Ninjas and Grand Master Ninjas
- Samurais
- Super and Dark Peasants
- Muskets
- Whole entire Neon faction
- The guy that spawns chickens
Now where did these all go??
I hope they come back again, but it was kind of a disappointment when I first opened the game and realised they weren't there. Also other units showcased in videos upcoming to the full release weren't released either. Some of these I was also really looking forward to messing around with, such as the Flamethrower and DaVinci Tank.
I understand that some things won't make the cut, but...
In conclusion there are multiple negatives to the game, however there is many positive aspects as well. I hope in the coming updates that these units will be added and the crash bug fixed.
- Pusher 8.5/10 Buy it, It's worth every penny!
P.S - Add workshop? (Custom maps,Units,Mods) And, Maybe a Modern faction!

This game is really good. It was good before, and after the character creation thingy it has gotten so much better. You can play online versus random people, and you can make campaigns, characters, maps and a lot more. This is a really good game. A solid 9/10

Posted: June 8, 2021
Ask me if I'd recommend this game when it released on steam. I'd say no, but after it's consistent development and interesting community especially with the youtubers who are relentless on content makes this game appeal to most audiences. I can't recommend it enough after the game is now damn full to the brim on things to do, units to create, campaigns to conquer and the custom factions to design the options are quite literally endless.
If you've got time to burn and fun to be had, this is your game no questions asked.

A tactical strategy game turned goofy. So much potential and hours can be spent making your own funny units and cools maps. Secret units can also be found around maps that can be extremely powerful or useful.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is def. worth it's current value. Admittedly the sandbox gets boring after not a lot of time, however, the campaign alone is worth the value. It throws dozens and dozens of premade level setups at you that you have to figure out how to defeat using your own unit comp ideas.
The ragdoll physics are great, the death animations are awesome and fun. Nothing beats seeing a spear or ballista bolt scewer the enemy in the head. The units do sometimes get stuck on terrain features though, which kinda blows, but this is something they can fix down the road.
There is about 3 hours worth of content alone in just the campaign. That isn't an incredible amount, however it's still early on and they are adding more levels, and the price of the game is super low anyway that it's def worth the price point.
There are tons of factions and unit types, the balance is really well done. There isnt a single thing thats overpowered, or totally useless garbage. Many levels require you to use many different unit types and get creative with army compisitions. And some units that may be able to destroy some levels, will get completely crushed in others.
Once the battles start, there isnt too much control other than slow motion. You cannot tell models to hold position, or to target specific enemies. However the slow motion really makes it eye-gasmic and thoroughly enjoyable to watch.
All in all for the price, it's def. worth it.

Good if you want to experience TABS early but I suggest you wait awhile until the constant crashing is fixed and possibly more units are added

This is a very stupid game and I love it. Kinda strategic, kinda dumb luck. Regular updates and lots of content.
Also my computer is a mid-range from 2010 and this still runs on it, which is a big selling point for me, obviously.
2021 Update:
I have a new PC and this game still rocks!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Review copy provided by developer
What do you call those games where you fight loose, noodley controls to perform the simplest tasks? Fumblecore? QWOP-likes? Infuriating? I played a riff on battle royale games that controlled like that called Totally Accurate Battlegrounds and it ended up being a great mix of hilarity and actual content. That surprised the hell out of me, and left me eager to see how the folks who made it would fare with their main game, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. Now that I have it, and have fumbled around with its floppy Early Access armies, I find myself surprised yet again at how much fun this thing is, even beyond what I was expecting.
It’s right there in the title, this is an extremely accurate simulator of historical battles, if you assume the wars of antiquity were fought with googly-eyed mammoths and drunken wheelbarrow racers. Whether dinking around in Sandbox mode or trying your hand at the many Campaign challenges already present, you will always have a small battlefield to work with. The field is divided down the middle, with red and blue forces limited to their respective sides. You choose and place soldiers from a variety of time periods and civilizations, and then click start. From that point on the battle is out of your hands, as your wibbly-wobbly troops wobble their wibbles to war, crashing ranks together in a cacophony of limbs, blades, arrows, snakes, and straw.
A general goes to war with the army he has, and in your case it’s a horde of gormless, boneless chickens yanked along by a drunken, invisible puppeteer. Your troops flop on their feet, flail their arms like spastic muppets, hook their weapons on walls, and scoot face-first through the dirt propelled by their butts. Any dreams you may have of forming perfect phalanxes, advancing troops under focused arrow volleys, or flanking formations with clever maneuvers must be put to rest now, because your soldiers will be lucky to not trip and drown in six inches of water. This is chaos, pure and simple, and the only control you have over it is the makeup of the walking disasters that catalyze it.
And it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hilarious. The beauty of TABS is not the same as something like Surgeon Simulator or Octodad; you’re not struggling to achieve something normal, you’re mashing flailing idiots into other flailing idiots. The opposing forces of every battle are taken from the same pool of units, separated into thematic groups like cavemen, villagers, knights, and vikings. A group will have a range of units, from clubbers and rock throwers to mammoths and bone wizards for the cavemen, for example, and each is worth a certain number of points. In the Sandbox you can use the point values of each side to judge their relative power, while in the Campaign you are limited to a certain number of points to beat each challenge. The important part, though, is that every unit is equally stupid and ridiculous, from the halflings that rocket face-first into foes to the longships that are carried onto the field and unceremoniously flung at their foes.
It can’t be ignored that TABS is still in Early Access, though that fact only rears its grotesque, incomplete head in a few places. Most notably for me is that the game likes to crash, specifically when you try to exit anyway and it just can’t seem to seal the deal. The interface is sparse and there’s no connective tissue between the Campaign levels, they’re just a sequence of challenges with goofy names and goofier battles. There are promised features on the horizon like three more groups of units (including natural enemies pirates and ninjas) and a unit creator which I simply cannot wait to see in action. But all of this is in fact fairly easily ignored when you’re lining up headbutting vikings against bales of hay with arms and legs.
Spectacle makes for some of the most memorable moments in gaming, and TABS is designed first and foremost to generate spectacle. Slowing down and zooming in to ground level to see your squires flail against knights, your cavemen explode skyward as a catapult shot slams into their ranks, your mammoths crash through hordes of farmers, and your ballista bolts tear through halflings like a railgun is all you need to put a smile on your face. All the flailing and floppy physics in the world are here not to inspire frustration, but laughter as you assemble armies of googly-eyed rubbermen and watch them slap each other silly. Even fresh into Early Access, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator feels like a total package of chaos and fun, giving you simple tools to watch simple armies beat the tar out of each other in hilarious fashion.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Evening descends on the snowswept Scandinavian tundra. Six blue-hued archers square off against a samurai. Six bowstrings twang. Six arrows speed toward their target. The samurai, his red armor glinting in the last dying rays of sunlight, shifts his stance. With a barely perceptible movement of his wrists, his blade describes a crescent in the frozen air. Six arrows flip end-over-end in every direction, one catching a blue archer in the throat. The archer tumbles bonelessly to the ground and is still. If his compatriots notice, they don't show it.
And then the samurai crouches, and in an instant he's among the archers, laying about himself with his blade, the cacophony of steel crashing against steel mingling with grunts of pain and screams of surprise. The archers realize too late that their foe is no mere samurai, but a shogun — a powerful feudal lord. Three archers stand, then two. One pierces the shogun's shoulder with a lucky shot, but an answering katana blow strikes him dead before he can celebrate. The last remaining archer, whose head is the size of a grapefruit and whose bow is held behind his back as though he's hiding a present from a toddler, looses an arrow that, predictably, does nothing. A flash of steel leaves him sprawling.
The shogun's breath fogs in the air. He turns limply toward the nearby forest and trudges forward, the arrow in his shoulder a painful memorial to the blue archer's death. There will be more killing before the night is through.
Also, this game is great and you should play it.

very good can simulate quite a few units at a time if you have a good computer. you can get quite a lot of anticipation for the next update and the secret units are a blast. the physics engine is AWESOME and when weird glitches happen its mostly really funny.

First bought this game, seemed pretty silly. It is silly, but in a good way. It's totally accurate, and it's just, you can spend hours upon hours creating battles with this game. Pretty good ost too, I'd say.
Edit: Is nice.
