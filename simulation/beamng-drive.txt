I've had it since it released on Steam day 1 and have accumulated 3700+ hours to date... I think I can safely recommend it.
It scratches my "senseless destruction" itch in so many ways.
Edit 2022: I have probably another 2000hrs on top of that total now but since I launch BeamNG through the BeamMP launcher to play online and race others, it doesn't accumulate playtime, sadly.
All this to say, get the BeamMP multiplayer addon.

Life is the best BeamNG.drive simulator.
Also, some things I like about this game:
I can resize the window by dragging the borders without messing anything up.
You can adjust weather.
You can adjust gravity.
You can adjust the speed of the game.
You can adjust the camera to practically any angle you want.
Many maps are included, which are very detailed and have many different areas.
Good graphics and optimization.
Many cars.
Many mods.
Dirt.
Rocks.
Water.
Good damage models.
Good physics.
Scenarios.
Games.
Console commands.
You can play with keyboard, controller, or steering wheel.
Cliffs.
Rivers.
Mountains.

The price.
And also a lot of other stuff that I forgot to mention.

Posted: July 18, 2018
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I am currently a traffic crash investigator for a Sheriff's Department in the US. Not only is this "game" fun, it has the potential to be a great tool in the field of traffic crash reconstruction. The physics engine hands down is VERY close to the real thing. Part of my job consists of taking real world crash data, reconstructing and mathematically remodeling crash and vehicle dynamics. That said, not only is this game (simulator really) extremely fun, it has the potential down the road to aid law enforcement in the reconstruction of fatal crashes. Similar programs that take raw physics data and convert them to 3D renderings such as this one can go for upwards of $50,000. Although Beamng.drive is not to the level of forensic software, it could be with some tweaking and insight.
I highly recommend this title and I can't wait to see what future updates hold. There are some bugs, but this isn't the full game and is to be expected.
To the developers ---- consider speaking with a consulting firm in crash reconstruction to get the correct formulas, equations, etc, and you could possibly license a professional version, which could spell big money. Some type of mode to enter real world vehicles, manipulate vehicle weights, be able to place them on a road at certain angles and certain speeds etc. would be awesome. I can tell you already that the game in its current state will yield crash results in the same ballpark, very close to the real world.

I've been driving for well over 20 years now, and I've never gotten myself into an accident.
20 years of uneventful driving. Just cruising along, always watching out for other drivers and reacting.
So imagine my sheer glee at the amazingly destructive power in BeamNG.drive! I've been playing for a long while now, and it still never gets old. I've driven myself off cliffs, smashed into guardrails, and decided to see what happens when you DO get into an accident.
BeamNG.drive is basically like my playground that lets me do all the bad things that I've always avoided in the past 20+ years of bad driving. I get to smash and mob around like an absolute loon, chuckle and nod at the destruction, and then do it all over again.
There's also apparently other modes other than Freeroam, which I've played a few times and are loads of fun. Buuuuuutt....if you'll excuse me, I need to see what happens when I take a 3 wheeled unstable vehicle over jump.

- She took the kids. ( WOW!! )

Biggest tips for new players who may be bored quickly: Explore the menus. BeamNG.drive is more than just crashing cars. By exploring every single menu (and sub menus inside of those menus) on the side-bar you open up A LOT of possibilities. From changing almost every component in your car, to making awesome replays, a bit of roleplaying, and setting up car chases.
Tip #2: Learn the shortcuts for menus and vehicle controls. You can do this via google or even exploring the controls menu.
Tip #3: Watch youtube videos to get some ideas what to do, maybe from YBR, or Mighty Car Vids, and Muye.
Tip #4: With Beam MP you can play online multiplayer with other people.
Tip #5: Don't underestimate the scenarios for entertainment.
Bonus Tip: Not all mods are on the in game mod repository, be it they're not ready for a full release, or for copyright reasons they cant be included. There are tons of extra mods on BeamNG.drives official website.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is THE best driving simulator i know.
why, you ask?
well first there is the soft body physics which are very similar to a real car. that means if you're rallying and you want to cut the corner and hit a rock with the suspension instead of the wheel, you will break your suspension. oh don't worry you can still finish, but you'll have to suffer the consequences of your decisions... or you can restart the scenario and try again with a fresh car to get a clean run! as the youtuber Jimmy Broadbent said: in beamng compared to so many other racing games, the car actually feels like an object you have to look after.
secondly there is the sheer amount of fun stuff you can do with this game like dirt rally, tarmac rally, track racing, drifting, derby, off road, drag, or simply just cruising in a comfy road car at comfy speeds. there is a career mode i have tried a little and intend to look into more with nice fun challenges that are not conventional of your typical racing sim. there are a lot of scenarios you can choose from, like classic dirt rallying (i really love dirt rally and it's really good in this game), police chases, cool stunts like in movies, deliveries, races (some light and breezy and some very challenging) and sooooo much more. i have played 20 hours so far and haven't even remotely scratched the surface of this game's content.
the maps in this game are very impressive. my favorite is Italy, a highly detailed and very huge map of a countryside in italy with very long serpentine roads, that go through the mountains and seaside with three cities to explore and drive in and countless dirt and gravel roads to put your rallying skills to the test. there is Industrial site, where you can practice your drifting, rallycross/derby. there is east coast usa where you can cruise on the highway and make cool police chase scenarios.
there is a photo mode in which i have made all of my most recent desktop backgrounds.
on top of all that there are a LOT of mods that can add to your driving experience and the devs are super supportive of them, even so that they made most of them accessible on their website and in game. you can download maps, components for your cars, new cars, and so much more. i recommend getting the nurburgring map mod. you can find it in the repository under the name ks_nord it's a super realistic FREE and SCANNED map of the legendary nurburgring circuit in the nurburg area in germany. most of the fanmade mod maps in this game looked really good to me and it's fun to see such a loving and passionate comunity in a racing game. also look up beammp which is a multiplayer mod for the game. it is being constantly looked after and updated by their creators and so far i find it really fun doing some roleplay with people, racing and cruising.
anyway. i could go on about this but i'd rather play the game instead. see ya!

This really isn't just a HURRR car go CRASH sort of game. On the surface it may look as so, but the customization of this game is top-notch, no other game comes anywhere close. The amount of parts and tuning you can do is astonishing and there's so many varied options across so many different cars.
What has me sold is the car handling. Get a gamepad or a wheel, it'll elevate the experience substancially. The handling is beyond superb, and hard to master. Once you do though, no other car or racing game comes close. Every other game will feel archaic and clunky, and honestly just utter garbage. This game has spoiled me and left me honestly surprised at how much value and hard-work went into a relatively inexpensive game. The developers in my personal opinion have made singlehandedly the most realistic and accurate depiction at how cars genuinely are.
Also get the multiplayer mod. Nothing really hits quite different than joining a police chase server and having high-speed chases with real people.

SUPER fun. After finding out about this, I went on a search to find any free games that could do what this thing could do. Nothing. Then, I took off the free filter, and still nothing compared! This game is a true simulation of physics, and it does it extremely well and accurately. The next best thing would be rigs of rods, but even that doesn't come anywhere close to the power and freedom you have in BeamNG. Highly recommended!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Originally, I had wrote a 2.5-page essay, explaining my review of BeamNG.drive after 2,000 hours. I later found out that Steam actually has a character limit on reviews, so I'm going to have to summarize it.
As of version 0.21, BeamNG outclasses every other game I've played (including those that aren't car games) in controller support, player control, mod support and simulation depth.
Currently, the base game lacks a main objective, shader quality and global optimizations, but it is still in development and based on its track record, it will continue to improve with every update.
I really wish I could post my entire review about the game here, but I guess the final paragraph will be good enough:
So, in conclusion, BeamNG.drive is still very much in early-access, but it has improved vastly from what it used to be, and continues to improve with every update. Almost every aspect about BeamNG.drive is much more advanced than anything else on the market, even with the odd “unfinished game” thing here and there. Because of that, and despite all of its flaws, I’d strongly recommend anyone who is into cars (and who has a PC powerful enough to run it) to give it a try. There are small things here that make it so BeamNG’s simulation is not quite perfect, but that being said, it is still the most in-depth automotive simulator that you can buy today.

For all the guys that say "BeamNG is empty and without content", i have to say, your imagination is empty and without content. As a child i used to play with my Toy cars and i made up huge crashes and everything blew up in my Fantasy and BeamNG is like the virtual playground i always wanted to play in. You can choose a stereotypical type of car (which you can tune and customize as you wish) and make up huuuuuge crashes with the most realistic deformation i have ever seen in a real time simulation. I can not suggest this "game" enough to people that always wantet to know how it looks when a semi truck rear ends a traffic jam or how it looks when you crash your sports sedan with 180 MPH into a static object. I love this piece of art and its my favourite game here on Steam! you can always jump in and drive a few hours and i will promise you that you will smile at some point!

BeamNG.drive is a very physics-heavy simulation, utilizing Torque3D and a very accurate, realistic soft-body physics engine. What does this mean for you, however? This game provides stunningly realistic vehicle deformations, much like Rigs of Rods, which BeamNG.drive is based off. BeamNG.drive tries to be the most accurate vehicle damaging simulator, and it is succeeding. While it is still only in Alpha, I strongly recommend picking this up if you're like me and find pleasure in smashing pickup trucks into small Japanese compact cars.
If you wish to own this title, you can order a Steam Alpha key at their website, http://www.beamng.com/

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
When I first downloaded this game a few years ago, I only had a gamepad and I just didn't get it. I didn't take the time to set up the controller and didn't really understand what the game is. But I love driving games (particularly rally sims - RBR, DR2.0, WRC9) and physics simulations so I spent a few hours on it and figured I'd revisit later. After quarantine started I got a wheel, so naturally tried every driving game I own with it. BeamNG.drive was by far the biggest surprise, and has quickly become one of my favorite games. Most of the cars handle as I'd expect, and I was impressed by the force feedback.
It took a couple mods to get me addicted. Pseudo Random Tour seems like a perfect mod for this game, and shows off how much content and potential there really is here. But as a rally fan, what really got me hooked was the pace notes mod (Pace Notes Core and the configuration) - Suddenly it's a rally sim, and in my opinion a really solid one. Finally, we have a game where the physics feels right, cars handle believably, and damage is realistic enough to make every risk a calculation. I don't really know how driving on tarmac compares to other games, but if you're into Dirt Rally, WRC or RBR, I'd definitely recommend checking it out. The off-road experience is exactly what I'd been wanting.
My only fear is that it could be hard to market a game like this and grow an ecosystem around it. This is a fantastic physics platform just begging to have a deeper game experience built on top of it, and I really, really hope they can create that. I'll be doing time trials in Utah until then.
Edit: I'm using a T300 RS GT with the Sparco R383 rim.

Oh, where to start...... I backed this game in 2014 on Kickstarter, and when it came to steam, i got a key. I couldn't TELL you how happy i was to finally play the game.... Aaand, ive never put it down since. I lost internet for awhile so i played it offline a ton because at the time it was the only game i had installed, so instead of 1300 hours i probably have more like 3000. It's got the BEST crash physics of any game made. Suspensions is simulated stupidly realistic. There are ton of modifcations you can do to the vehicles within the game that make them handle different, or faster, and recently, with the tire update, this is probably one of the best feeling games you can get on a wheel other than IRacing. I'm telling you, if you dont own this game PLEASE buy it, its worth every penny of its price if you're a gearhead like me, and enjoy hotrodding and playing with cars

Ah, BeamNG. Probably one of the hardest games to write a review for, with the vast amount of stuff this game offers. Like driving cars? This game has cars. It also has trucks. There's also a van. And a piano. There's also a functional cannon.
Like crashing cars? You can do that. Whether you chuck it off a cliff, slam it into a tree, crash it into another car, or yeet it into a destructible brick wall, you're almost always to get realistic results each and every time.
Like driving? You can drive. Sometimes at over 300 miles per hour. You can also drive at many places, including, but not limited to: Italy, Utah, The U.S. West Coast, the U.S. East Coast, and a flat grid. You can also make your own places to drive, though its a pretty complex process.
Not satisfied with the standard game? You can get mods, including custom vehicles such as: Dog, really-really-really tall van, big tires, and a foam block wall. There are also mods that add new places to drive to the game, such as: really long highway, ski jump designed for cars, and a couple of maps that cant really be described using text.
Worried the game wont run on your system? Alright, thats actually a reasonable thing to be worried about. This is a VERY hardware intensive game, but it can run on rather low-end devices, albeit, poorly. Chances are, if your setup is from 2014 or later, you can probably get 45+ FPS at most maps.
At the end of the day, this is a really fun vehicle sandbox game. I'd recommend it to anybody who likes cars or games with really good destruction physics.

Ever since purchasing this game a few years ago, every time this game gets a update it becomes even better. For the price, you get many hundred of hours of fun.
This game however is highly focused on freeroam, which means creating your own fun. This may put some people off.
This is one of the few games that will leave you begging for one of the high-quality updates.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...
The Good(AKA:Everything):
-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).
-Great cars and maps with nice little details.
-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.
The Bad(AKA:What bad?):
-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.
-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.
-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)
And well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun. So, in short, I HIGHLY recommend this game!
If you read this far, thank you so much! I tried my best here!

When I first saw the game, it was nothing more than a softbody tech demo for the cry-engine, but
I was interested enough to buy the game once it was announced.
After all this time I never got tired of the game. This is thanks to the continuing development and striving mod community.
If you ever wondered what a small Italian two-seater with a 500+ hp american v8 would become after it met a wall at 120mph, wonder no more and try it out yourself.
Definitely a recommendation for all racing and sandbox enthusiasts.
Edit: After adding an additional 100+ hours, this still holds true. Both the developers and the community keep supporting the game and adding vehicles, maps and missions. The next big step for the game will be its "story" mode which is currently playable as a pre-release test.

Honestly this game is my dream game because of WhyBeAre, and I certainly never regretted purchasing it since 2017. Such a relaxing game to drive, yet if you crashed it would be so satisfying. Oh yeah, don't forget to download the BeamMP mod for multiplayer, it's the best mod ever- EVER! So yeah, don't hesitate to buy it's such a brilliant game.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Having just realized I have 1000+ hours of total game-play on BeamNG.drive, I think it's best to write a detailed description as to why this game is so amazing.
First off, the physics themselves are outstanding. This is pretty much as realistic as it gets regarding vehicle physics and dynamics. Without using modifications, this game only has a limited number of vanilla game maps, but ENDLESS ways to be creative and have fun. Drive on different maps, install mods that better improve game-play & just have fun. I seriously love this game, I'm on it about 2-3 times a week usually.
Updates are fairly uncommon, but when they are released the updates have a lot to offer. Granted some updates were just downright ridiculous and hated (by me and other community members), they have most always fixed their game problems/bugs within the following week or so. The developers are seriously so dedicated to their role at advancing this game to the next level. I will admit, some changes are not worth it to me, but that it me. Overall this game is awesome.
One of my favorite parts about this game, is that they allow and make it easy for users to create community mods, able to be installed even while in-game. Yes, there are some off-site mods for realistic vehicles, but we won't go there. Anyway, the fact that they allow users to release their creations makes this game just that much better. There are so many modifications that you can install to your liking, most of them are great.
In summary, this game is great. It was and is cool to see the progress that they have made from when they started out to what it is now. Keep up the great work devs, and make sure to keep listening to your community on both positive and negative feedback, it's what makes a good game! Not many gave devs. listed to/care about their community.

MOTION BLUR IS DISABLED BY DEFAULT. 10/10.
​
This game is actually 10/10. Not for that reason alone though, lol... It is an amazing sandbox physics game as well as an amazing driving game. You can either mess around and destroy vehicles, or do serious racing with other people online (using a mod). If you plan on racing in this game, though, I HIGHLY suggest using a PC steering wheel, or at least a controller. You can get away with using keyboard controls when you're just messing around with the physics, but if you ever want to win a race, you'll need more than that.
​
I definitely recommend getting BeamNG. Whether you want to play around with the physics or do some competitive racing, both are excellent in this game.
