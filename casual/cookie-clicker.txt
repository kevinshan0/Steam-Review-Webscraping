Posted: September 2, 2021
I basically just bought this game to say thank you to the devs.
Years ago when I was poor this was the only game running on my notebook I had to apply to jobs, before it broke some day.
Now that I have a proper job here it is: Thanks for the good times I had with this game. It was fun and still is, it even brought me into the whole idle/clicker-game section. Even nowadays where I can play all high end games I enjoy clicker games every now and then and always compare them to cookie clicker.
Thanks.

You click a cookie, you get a cookie.
Let's start off simple; this game is the web version, and both the Web AND Steam versions will recieve the same updates. By purchasing this you're mainly supporting the developers and getting access to a downloaded version of the game.
The Steam Benefits:
Cloud Saving (Thank God)
That glorious C418 Background Music
"Heralds" Bonus that isn't tied to Patreon
Workshop support for mods in the future
Overall, i'm really happy to see the game hit the steam store.

CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES RECIPE
Ingredients
120g butter, softened
75g light brown sugar
75g golden caster sugar
1 medium egg
1 tsp vanilla extract
180g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
150g dark chocolate, cut into chunks
STEP 1
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment. Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla. Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.
STEP 2
Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading. Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the middle – they will harden a little as they cool. Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.

Fun Fact: Did you know that, when minimized, Cookie Clicker uses about 200MB of your RAM and less than 0.5% of your CPU?
Fun Fact: Did you know you can have multiple Steam games open simultaneously?

I haven't gotten to the part yet where you click the cookie but outside of that it is a decent game.

A lot of folks have asked me "why on earth would you pay for this if it's free online?" and there are plenty of nice little reasons to, like the cloud saves and the steam achievements, and the music. But personally for me it's more of a little thank you note to the developers. It's a small token of my appreciation for the unceasing effort given to this cute little passion project over the course of the past eight years. Five bucks is a steal, honestly.

Ingredients for cookies:
225g butter, softened
110g caster sugar
275g plain flour
1 tsp cinnamon
75g white or milk chocolate chips (optional)
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Cream the butter in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or in a stand mixer until it is soft. Add the sugar and keep beating until the mixture is light and fluffy. Sift in the flour and add the optional ingredients, if you’re using them. Bring the mixture together with your hands in a figure-of-eight motion until it forms a dough. You can freeze the dough at this point.
STEP 2
Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place them slightly apart from each other on a baking sheet. Flatten the balls a little with the palm of your hand and bake them in the oven for around 10-12 mins until they are golden brown and slightly firm on top. Leave the cookies on a cooling rack for around 15 mins before serving.

Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe
Ingredients:
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, which should take about 2 minutes with an electric mixer.
Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; you want the dough to come together without overworking it.
Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula or wooden spoon.
Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft. The exact baking time may vary based on your oven, so keep a close eye on the cookies.
Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of cold milk!

Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies
1 and 1/2 cups (188g) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup (2 sticks; 230g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
1 cup (200g) packed light or dark brown sugar
1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 Tablespoon unsulphured or dark molasses
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
3 cups (240g) old-fashioned whole rolled oats
1 and 3/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
Whisk the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar and beat on medium-high speed until creamed, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, molasses, and vanilla and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, beat in the oats and both types of chocolate chips. Dough will be thick and sticky. Cover and chill the dough for at least 45 minutes in the refrigerator (and up to 4 days). If chilling for longer than a few hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.
Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
Use a large cookie scoop to scoop the cookie dough, about 3 Tablespoons of dough per cookie, and place 4 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 13-14 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look very soft.
Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cookies are still warm, I like to press a few more chocolate chips into the tops– this is only for looks!
Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Relationships broken. Friendships ruined. Family pushed away. All for the cookies. Once you click the first cookie, you won't stop. You can't stop. The cookies are the only thing that matters. Nothing else in the world does. After the first click, it will spread though you like a virus. Growing and growing until you are fully consumed. No, don't try and run. You can't stop the inevitable. There is still more in store. Hundreds and thousands of cookies per second. Grandmas ripped from their family's. Cookie factory's destroying the earth's atmosphere. Don't worry, its all for the greater good. Millions and billions per second. Shipments brought in from other planets. Inter-dimensional travel, bringing cookies from other realms. Don't try to fight it. It will only make it stronger. Trillions per second. Prisms turning light into cookies. Creating cookies through sheer luck. And then the Grandma Apocalypse. Destroying cites, merging with the environment and creating monsters to take down your empire. The Grandmas have become a superior being. But nothing can stop the Cookies. Nothing ever will. You can contain the Grandma's wrath and control the monsters into helping your empire. Quadrillions of cookies per second. Now you have made connection with other idle universes like your own and convert what they are creating into cookies. Quintillions of cookies per second. Today is the day. You have taken of the multiverse. Your cookies are all that their is. Your think that you have reached the final destination, the end of the road, the last junction and that you can be finally freed. But no. It is only just beginning. As you see the world you have created fade into darkness. And the cookies that you have created left behind you realize that you are no longer a human. That your have gone beyond what was ever possible. You have become a god."Oh hello, I didn't know you were here. You have done all that was asked of you. Almost all. I hope you have enjoyed your time here but it is time for you to go. But before you go, I will let you ask one question and no more." You contemplate your choices and you ask in a slow cautious voice,"What are you." And the Voice replies in a slow calm voice," I am you". Before you can try to figure out what that means you are transported back to the mortal world. Everything that you have created is gone. All that is left is the Big Cookie. You thought you were free, but you were wrong. You are stuck here forever. Doomed to repeat the cycle over and over forever and ever. Never to escape.
Great game would recommend.

It's like having sex, but all the time. And it costs less than a pack of Trojans.

Went 60 days without ascending thinking there would be some kind of achievement if i got at least 1 of all the buildings before doing so... I cracked at the 2nd to last building with a prestige of 4000. I thought that was going to be alot... It took me less than 10 minutes to get to where i was. Two months of my life checking this game only to realize ive been playing it weird...
anyways, i like watching number go up. Also i want all the achievements, and the achievements are funny. Ill quit when i get them all.

using cookie clicker to cope with my lack of grandmas
Posted: September 6, 2021
So after 15 hours playing this game non-stop i broke my mouse, never buying Razer again, it just can't handle it , this game is too good.
Other than that this game is very entertaining i would recommend buying it 100%, be careful is very addictive though.

Been baking cookies for over 7 years. A few years of not having it open, but it baked them anyway in its dormancy. I have baked over 100 octodecillion cookies (yes I use autoclickers, duh), which I didn't even know was a number. This is the greatest game ever created.
