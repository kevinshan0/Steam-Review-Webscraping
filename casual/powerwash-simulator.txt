Game where my son or I can play for a bit and whoever picks it up next it is OK, no worries about my save or his and we just keep going and have fun. My son is pretty young but still recognizes the satisfaction of clean.
Some of the jobs are pretty big.
Please add split screen for this game so my son and I can work on a project together at the same time.

Dear PowerWash Simulator Devs,
This is a very simple concept that is pulled off well. Thanks for a great start.
Now, I'm just some dude, but it is my belief that if you added a *public, user-rated level-editor*, you would never have to work another day in your lives.
Best of luck!

I've powerwashed nearly every level (except the subway station and the fountain maybe) 10+ times.
It's only now starting to get boring.
Now imagine this game, but with workshop levels.

I dont understand why this game has negative reviews about the gameplay. Dont get me wrong, there are valid criticisms like how there arent really keybinding options and stuff however half of them are complaining about how the game is dull and all you do is powerwash. This game is literally called powerwash simulator, what did you expect?

Step 2: Put on your favorite music or something chill and calming.
Step 3: Boot up this game and let your mind wander.
Step 4: Reflect on life/perhaps get a little sad.
Step 5: Wash away the dirt and wash away the past.
Step 6: Feel better and clean.

This game is absolutely ridiculous. Swiping surfaces up and down in repetitive motions for hours. Cleaning a million nooks and crannies, sitting in front of the computer screen like a hypnotized zombie.
Two reasons why I recommend this game: One, it is the perfect game for switching off your brain, when you want to advance time and you don't have a cryosleep chamber nearby. Two, at some point playing this game, you will pause and be forced to consider whether or not you are living your life to the fullest. Hence, the repercussions of playing this game could lead to a dramatic existential crisis, when you realize all the precious heartbeats you have wasted while being zombified will never come back.

I got this game to help deal with my anxiety. For hours I would meticulously clean every career mode level with my elderly cat by my side, insisting on hindering me as much as possible by using my mouse hand as a pillow. When I got to the fishing boat I ended up having to say the last goodbye to her. Today I finished career mode and felt like a complete idiot choking up at the post credits scene. 20/10, would wash again. RIP Bathory, the best little black cat, 2008-2024.

Probably the most realistic Dad simulator I've ever played. You wash dirty things and at the end they come out clean. And then you get money and a gif of you cleaning the thing. Simple. Clean. Satisfying.
Posted: February 26, 2023
This game stands on a mighty pedestal above everything else with a half-ironic "simulator" title released in the past two decades.
PowerWash Simulator is not a sim, and it knows that. Every object you clean is just a texture layered on another texture, and different nozzles/guns remove that texture more efficiently than others. You're waving a Photoshop delete tool around for twenty hours.
The beauty of PWS comes from the writing. This isn't one of the dozens of shovelware Polish 'sim' games pumped out every quarter. The writing isn't edgy for the sake of being edgy to give streamers something to react to during the first two hours. Story and charming character work doesn't magically stop happening after the two hour Steam refund window is up. If anything, the breadcrumbs of story in PWS snowball into a big, goofy, overarching story about wacky occurrences in this small metro area that all - coincidentally - require the services of a professional power washer.
If you've read this far, please take it from me: power through the tree house level. Keep in mind that hitting the C button to detatch your cursor and allow you to move the washer around the screen is a CRUCIAL tool. Ignore the stats on the washers, they're all direct upgrades.

When I'm having a stressful day this is the game I'll be turning to. Wasn't feeling the best mentally yesterday, bought it, played for almost 8 hours and felt much more relaxed afterwards. ❤
Posted: July 17, 2022
I have played over 400 hours of this game and I will continue to do so.
I have just finished the main story line and all the maps are beautiful and just hella satisfying to clean. The game is relaxing and, as a person who routinely suffers from anxiety, I find the game almost like my ''happy place''. When I am having a bad day or anxious about a situation that has come up, this game helps.
I hope the developers know how much I love this game and I am hoping they will continue to update with new maps, even if the career mode is now complete. I would very much love to see new map updates, as this is going to be a game I will always return to.
Thank you so much Power Wash Devs, it has been an awesome year of cleaning and I look forward to the years to come.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
EDIT: Almost 2100 hours I've logged in this game. It sucks that I have to say this: do not buy any of the DLC except for nostalgia purposes. Be careful even then. That being said, not even my extreme Final Fantasy VII nostalgia could make me like the Midgar pack. Spongebob and Tomb Raider? Don't waste your money. This team has gotten away, FAR away, from the winning formula that made this game great. It was unique, it was innovative, but now it's banking on other brands for a fresh breath of life. Now, everything is an intense slog to find every tiny nook and cranny and getting just the precise angle to clean 99.9999% of every dirt speck because your completion thresholds are ridiculous. The base game is worth it, but don't bother with anything else.
Go back to what you started with. Expand on that. FINISH THE STORY. Stop trying to turn a buck because you rode the wave of popularity and are now too lazy to want to do anything but make bank off other people's creations, with or without their permission.
Probably won't be playing this much more except when my friends want to play. This game has become a serious disappointment.
EDIT: Almost 1600 hours in, and I am convinced I was a power washer in a previous life.
I have no life now. I've sold all my worldly possessions except my PC and gaming setup. I live off ramen and multivitamins. I've reset my progress more than a speedrunner playing Ninja Gaiden. I see orange flashes in my dreams, and then I wake up only to be reminded that I missed three tiny specks on the last level I played, so I have to reset everything and start over. If God exists, when I meet them I will ask them one question: "can I get the extra long extension prior to the fire helicopter?" To which they will answer "no, my son, you gotta put in the work."

Multiple nights of me playing this and streaming it in discord with my good friend Aaron. Sometimes we were muted the whole time. Other times we were muted at all but wouldn't say a word for hours. There will be a power wash sized hole left in my heart now that I am done with this game. I patiently await part II.

I really like this game, very satisfying :)
The only "grievance" I have with this game is that it seems things are considered clean when you reach a certain percentage, that's fine for most thing. But my inner perfectionist feels a bit cheated when it comes to big objects like walls and floors, like I'm getting punished for being thorough. I've cleaned almost the entire wall/floor and there's only one big patch of dirt left in the middle. I start on it, but then the wall is considered clean enough and the big patch of dirt just disappears xD and I'm sitting there like "but I wasn't done D:" but yeah, that's probably just me, so if no one else complains about it, just forget it, hehe x)

As someone in their early 40s this game is a god sent. I like shooters, most of my life I played shooters but as of late the kid that killed me and teabagged me called me a boomer 3 times before I realise I am dead. (I need to protest, I am gen x, not a boomer, nor a milenial)
My reflexes have become ♥♥♥♥. And while a few years ago I could compensate my slow pysical decline by playing methodical and strategic I can't any more.
This is where this shooter comes in. It lets me show everything I have learned, mastered, perfectioned one last time. From mastery of shooting angles to choice of right tool (sniper to spray and pray).
Also the bell chime that chimes everytime you finish cleaning a part is awesome. Conditioned to produce dopamine like a dog. Awesome!
Posted: August 6, 2021
This game comes with a really stupid simple premise that's done extraordinarily well - you spray water at things until they're clean. Doesn't sound like fun, but it's incredibly soothing and satisfying to see something covered in mud and dirt suddenly pop with live and vibrant colors - and sorting out a method of which you tackle these projects is a different sort of fun in itself.
Think of it like a coloring book from your childhood - except the giant building is the book and the pressure washer is your crayon. The level of organization (or chaos) is up to you. Do you want to spray a bunch of wangs in the mud? Or do you just want to climb on top of the truck and start spraying from there? The grime is your oyster.
Also, the game has a story for some reason. The people you get the projects from text you while you clean their crap and it's hilarious and charming - there's actually a few of the reoccurring customers that I came to enjoy and looked forward to seeing if I get to do more for them!
Edit: No, seriously, this game has a story. I'm not crying, I just got soap in my eye...

This game is great for when you need to sit back and let your ADHD brain experience something soothing and something you can completely sink into. Similar feeling to using a real power washer or watching a video of one. I am a completionist myself and I speed through games like nobody's business; however, for some maps it takes me days to complete. It makes me want to take a break and come back to it the next day and most games can't hold my attention like that. Once again def get this game.

This game will help you relax and will also make you laugh. If you have a friend to play it with, it is even better. However, with continued play, you will notice things around you that need to be power-washed. It is inevitable.
There is still more content being released, both free and paid. This is something special for any game.
Posted: July 8, 2023
My most played simulator title, and I'm not even done yet. Not sure if this game is very long, or I'm just very slow.
It's also the most relaxing game that I own. Anyone can play it. You just clean dirt, that's all there is to it. Great title to play while listening to youtube/podcasts/music.
The only thing that could make it even better are custom maps. With mod/steam workshop support. This game would reach a whole different lvl of potential and longevity.
I would still reccomend it as it is.
