Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles don’t really mean anything? How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying “I have underestimated you! You are a worthy opponent! This is not the end! We shall meet again!” and make a getaway? Think about it. How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch? How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him? How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do? And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel?
Undertale asks the question, “What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die?”
This might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Undertale will also pit you against several main characters. If you defeat a main character in battle, they’re dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it. Heavy stuff.
But thankfully, as the game advertises, you don’t actually have to kill anyone! The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting. This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the “Act” menu in battle. The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you’re fighting; sometimes you’ll just need to give them a compliment, other times you’ll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on. Once they’re not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can “spare” them, and the battle ends. You won’t get any EXP for it, but you’ll still get gold. It’s a very unique fighting mechanic!
I admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story’s presentation. I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game’s content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else. The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone. “Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry?” I asked myself. “Where are the feelings? After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more?”
Later that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone’s life. I wasn’t playing as a murderer. If you want this game to have drama, you have to cause it. And I think that’s where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice. This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between. You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won’t let you ignore what you have done.
Though it isn’t the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn’t always the best, Undertale has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art. It tried some new and ambitious things and isn’t ashamed of what it wanted to be. It's about 6 hours long; I’d recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer. It’s hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience.

Ten dollars. Only a few hours of gameplay. 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games.
But... wow. Undertale blew me away. It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment. It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience.
I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it. I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses. So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name. And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it. So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience. I'm sorry.
Of course, I call Undertale an "experience", not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it. Following the motto on the store page, "the game where you don't have to destroy anyone", the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to "Spare them!". And of course, you answer with "Why? Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me? What's in it for me?" And that's where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the game's selling point. And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here.
Undertale's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive. Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing. If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you. It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced. You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss. The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards.
On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it. If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend. And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple moment of "Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes"... the weight of a dark choice is huge. Nothing can be taken back, and it forever changes your playthrough. Reset the game, and the characters know. Events change. And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents. In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story. Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing. There's very little reward for going through this route. Yet it is a choice you can do. Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game... It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route. Before its too late.
It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world. And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you. It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice. The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired. Go clean, or go home tainted. The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending. The happiness you worked so hard to earn. And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again. That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice. Amazing.
Yes, this game might not be for everyone. The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it. But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot. Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it. This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten.
It is a sin to call Undertale a game. Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free "kill-em-all" genres that a lot of games are falling into now.
Undertale is a story-driven, emotional experience.

At a first glance, Undertale probably looks like any other bland/low budget RPG but looks can be deceiving. Underneath the pixelated exterior lies a gem that I would consider to be the crown jewel of indie games: a highly successful kickstarter that was conceptualized and developed (mostly) by one person (Toby Fox).
To this day, I still reminisce about my multiple playthroughs and still regularly listen to the soundtrack (and covers). Simply thinking about the game fills me with determination.
Played with keyboard
Positive:
Lately I have been hesitant to describe a game as “unique”. Given how saturated the gaming market is, truly unique games have become harder to come by. In fact, it is often easier to just resell nostalgia. Think of endlessly milked game-series (i.e. FIFA) and the large influx of remasters/remakes. Furthermore, “unique” can sometimes be a “non-word”; a lazy descriptor that doesn’t actually say much about a game.
Undertale is unique in the best way possible. I am not exaggerating when I say that I have never played anything quite like it. I would go as far to say that this game has shifted the paradigm for future 2D turn-based RPGs. Having played so many RPGs before, I mindlessly jumped into Undertale with the usual RPG mentally; kill bad monster, level up good. Without giving away too much, I will simply say that this game made me question my subconscious bias and left me determined to replay multiple times.
In the hopes that this game will have a similarly profound impact on you (whoever is reading this), I intentionally wrote this review to be as vague and with as few spoilers as possible.
Lovely story that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. Undertale excels at balancing moments with different moods whether they are tense, heartfelt, relaxing, or entertaining. This wholesome (assuming you are not a psychopath) adventure presents you with a myriad of over-the-top but lovable characters and places you in hilariously bizarre situations. Even during battle sequences, regular enemies and bosses can be charming and full of personality.
Your choices matter and heavily impact the story. What I especially love is that the game is fun and challenging regardless of the decisions/path you take. My partner and I can vouch that it is a delightful experience for both new and veteran gamers.
Absolutely brilliant combat system. This system combines the strategic side of turn-based combat with the mechanical demands of real-time events: quick time events for attacks and bullet-hell style events for dodging enemy attacks. This combination counteracts the downsides of either system, [turn-based] can feel slow and not engaging enough; [real-time] can be too difficult for less experienced gamers, resulting in a challenging but not too stressful experience.
Sublime OST. I highly recommend you check out the fantastic metal covers by Falkkone (Youtube).
Negative:
I am a monster for doing it, I thought I had no choice. Please forgive me. ಥ﹏ಥ
Deltarune[www.deltarune.com] can’t be released soon enough (FYI you can play chapter 1 for free).
Verdict:
★★★★★ Exceptional
A modern classic and personal favorite. Highly recommended to all (including my future children).

I hated Undertale.
It was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.
Then my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it.
I played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about "what would happen if I did this?", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.
Also, the skeletons aren't even sexy.
My advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.
And when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?
So, yes. I hated Undertale.
And then I played it.

Very good game, multiple play throughs are included which makes the game replayable so the amount of time you spend on it varies on how many times you want to play through it, three routes included (genocide, neutral, pacifist). Plot line is beautiful, comedic, emotional and the characters and story line were unique and easy to follow. Despite the toxic fandom that may put you off the game, all in all, this game is an incredible one and I, personally, definitely recommend it.

This is one of those few games that come along when times are bleak, and games have become regularly bland and heartless. Where you feel disenfranchised with the whole idea of video games. And you begin to start ask "Why?"... Like "Why should we play games?", "Why are games different from other media?", "Why should you use games as a form of expression?" and even "Why even play games at all?!"
Undertale come along and says, "This is why."

When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting.
I was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game.
I normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was.
In reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore.
You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly.
Story/writing: 10
Music: 8
Replay value: 7
Gameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything.

When this little game rolled onto the Steam storefront on September 15th of 2015, I think it’s pretty safe to say hardly anyone probably could’ve imagined the impact it would have. I know I certainly didn’t; after all, my first exposure to Undertale came in the form of seeing the backlash its own fanbase brought upon it, alongside the vocal cynics and critics who panned it as “overrated garbage”. With claims flying left and right that it was the next Five Nights At Freddy’s and constant jokes about how it was “Tumblr’s favorite game”, I had plenty of reason to be skeptical.
When I looked into things myself, though, I found something far different than what I had been anticipating. Even from the very first moments I saw it in action, Undertale…connected with me, in a way few games have ever managed to, first impression or otherwise. As time continued on, I was shocked to see just how much love the game was receiving, including praise from such people as Totalbiscuit and Yahtzee (people known to have trouble enjoying most JRPGs), and so it rapidly became clear that there had to be something to this game; something big. If it could so thoroughly draw in even those who typically can’t enjoy the genre, then if nothing else, it had to be worth checking out.
I went in with some damn high expectations.
What I got was one of the best games I’ve ever played.
I truly wish I had the words to properly explain what Undertale is to me. I could go on for hours about the near-perfection of the soundtrack. I could rave about the writing and how rewardingly rich in detail and nuance it is. I could praise it for its characters and the level of care put into making even the most minor NPCs come to life with personality. I could write a freakin dissertation on the sheer brilliance of how it uses meta not only to comment on the tropes and conventions of its genre, but also as a powerful gameplay and storytelling tool that rewards replay value. I could gush until the end of time about the powerful messages Undertale presents and the skill with which it presents them, even addressing real world issues with an inspiring amount of dignity.
However, what I truly adore the most about this game is how unapologetic it is. It’s never afraid to be what it is, and that confidence takes its strengths and makes them into something far greater than the sum of those parts. From start to finish, Undertale is one of the most utterly brilliant games I’ve ever seen, executed with a pitch-perfect prowess that creates an experience the likes of which few other games can match.
There is always something new; another layer to be peeled back; another beautiful detail to be discovered. And the deeper one digs, the more brilliantly this absolute diamond of a gem sparkles. No part of Undertale is manufactured: not a single pixel has escaped the loving caress of a gentle crafting hand, and as the offspring of a mere $51,000 Kickstart (over 10x the amount Toby asked for), it’s easily one of the most refreshing games of the last few years. Undertale made me laugh. Undertale made me cry. Undertale made me think deeply about the world around me.
But most powerfully of all, Undertale touched me unlike any game before it. It's no small wonder, then, that upon completion it became my favorite game that I've ever played.
Yes indeed, this wonderfully unforgettable experience.
It fills me.
With determination.
I adore this game.

9.5/10
Undertale is a game that has gained a considerable reputation, and even if you haven't played it, you've likely heard of it to some extent. While graphics and size are not the sole determinants of a game's quality, at first glance, it's hard to imagine how Undertale garnered so much praise with its seemingly simplistic graphics and "simple" gameplay. In reality, Undertale absolutely deserves all the praise it has received, and even now, many elements and its music continue to exude vitality in various other domains.
The game incorporates elements from traditional RPGs and Manic shooters in its gameplay, but what makes Undertale truly outstanding is not its gameplay but rather its storytelling and music. In terms of the story, Undertale presents players with a genuinely moving yet unconventional narrative about family, friendship, trust, and betrayal, employing a natural and unpretentious narrative approach. The game's interactivity is also remarkably high, allowing players to deeply experience the impact of their actions within the game and explore countless details to fully appreciate the game's charm. The characterization of the main characters in the game is vivid and lively, effectively showcasing their glamour. As for the music, Undertale's original and captivating soundtrack, combined with the game's storyline, provides players with a profound dual impact on their emotions and auditory senses.
No matter how exceptional a masterpiece may be, it is not exempt from criticism. However, in my view, this is not a game's flaw. Since the game's primary focus is almost entirely on crafting its narrative content, if you're not interested in most games' stories or cannot derive any emotional resonance from them, Undertale may not be suitable for you. Similarly, the game's systems are relatively intricate and complex, encompassing numerous puzzle-solving elements. Additionally, it deviates significantly from most typical RPG games, making the game much more challenging without guidance, and experiencing all the game's content in its entirety may require many meticulous operations. Furthermore, any spoilers regarding the game's plot can significantly undermine the gaming experience, putting players in a dilemma between relaxing walkthroughs and preserving the integrity of the experience. Certain routes in the game also pose considerable difficulty, rivaling that of hardcore Manic shooters, which may hinder all kinds of players from smoothly experiencing all of the game's content.
Undertale is an absolute must-play, worth experiencing for the majority of players. Please be careful not to get in touch with any game spoiler content, as it will greatly diminish the impact of the gaming experience. While it may require more time, it is undoubtedly worth it. If you don't enjoy narrative-driven games, dislike spending time exploring the game's content on your own, and don't enjoy empathizing with the game's characters, then Undertale may not be suitable for you.

(Mostly spoiler-free review)
I hate turn-based RPGs. This is my Game of the Year. What.
After becoming ULTRA-JADED about gaming with the cancellation of Silent Hills, this game re-established that games can be really, really frickin good.
This thing was made with an incredible amount of love, and it shows in every nook and cranny, every joke, every secret conversation you never thought a game dev would have thought to include. Tobyfox is the most thorough dev ever. I'm continuously impressed with how many things he thought to include in this game, and how he managed to make it all extremely fun the entire way through. You'd think you've seen everything in this game, but you haven't. There's always another amazing thing, another way to turn the genre on its head, another great joke you didn't see coming. And it stays engaging the entire time, supported by a cast of fantastic, endearing, hilarious characters. Great puzzles too, imo!
It avoids all the things about (turn-based and non) RPGs that I despise:
-There's no grinding (unless you want to)
-Battles are a great length and never overstayed their welcome for me
-There's no boring menu-navigation-only-based combat (bullet dodging/timing-based stuff really spices it up, as well as bossfights always having a new, really fun gameplay twist on them!)
-There's no unlikable/unrelatable characters that go on and on about you being the "Chosen One" or whatever
-No plot where you gotta go to the 7 temples and find the 7 sacred whatevers and then oh wait now that you've gotten those 7 sacred whatevers, you gotta go to 4 extra places and get 4 SUPER sacred whatevers...
-No backtracking (unless you want to! Backtracking is actually usually rewarded with more fun conversations and such.)
-No constant equipping and unequipping items because, oh, this one is +2 Def but -3 Speed but THIS one is +3 Speed and -2 Def but THIS one is immune to fire and this one is...
-It actually has a way more complex, useful moral than "Evil is Bad, Good is Good." Everyone has relateable motivations.
-The writing doesn't suck like 90% of RPGs. It has a wonderful sense of humor and a simple plot that is underlaid with complex emotions.
-Has jokes about anime, doesn't take itself seriously.
I could gush about it forever. Undertale's not only made me less jaded about gaming, but also less jaded about real life. It has a strong message about empathy that stays everpresent, while somehow not being cloying about it, or shoving the message down your throat. It's simply a wonderful experience, please play this thing!!

This game is like that one day when you were sick, so you didn't go to school and your favorite cartoon series was on a 24h marathon, and it was snowing, and it was actually two weeks till christmas, and you were getting your dream Lego set, and you were cuddled in bed, and there was pie, and you just played video games all day and oh my god im crying
Play this game. NOW.
Posted: August 16, 2017
a lot of negative reviews claim this game's community is "awful", "cancerous" and "perverted".
they might be right
however, it looks like those people did not get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ memo that this place is for reviewing the game, and not the fanbase. why is fanbase even important in the first place? you can simply ignore it, if worst comes to worst.
so what about the game?
really, there are only two issues i have with undertale. once you begin the game, the first couple hours are absolutely boring as all hell. i have a feeling this might just be me though, because no one else seems to have similar gripes.
the second, more pertinent issue, is that the game lacks length. if you can read, you can see that i've played undertale for about 30 hours, and that's about as long as it's probably going to last you if you progress at a decent pace. keep in mind that i've very literally done everything there is to do and seen everything there is to see in these 30 hours.
now that that's out of the way, please consider the following:
the game has a really good story. i'm not gonna lie, one of the game's 3 endings almost made me cry. i'm not an emotional person either. i've played through games with truly gripping, touching stories like spec ops: the line and felt next to nothing, but undertale absolutely knocks the competition out of the park.
when i saw the credits roll for the last time, and knew that my time with undertale was done, i got the same feeling i've only felt before after finishing a very good book. i was sad because it was done, and sad because it would be a long time before anything would ever come close to the experience i'd had.
ok, well now you know how undertale affected me. let me explain why this happened.
1. undertale has wonderful music: toby fox, the game's maker, is actually not a writer nor programmer, but a "music producer". this complements perfectly the excellent battle system, which i'm about to discuss
2. battles. some of the game's battles, especially battles where you really are the bad guy (if you play the game you'll se what i mean), are exceptional. the epic momentum of toby fox's well written score works perfectly with the fun and fluid combat.
3. writing. toby fox seems to have a rare talent for excellent dramatic/comedic timing. if you play the game, as you should, you will see exactly what i mean. furthermore, the characters and story are just really fleshed out. in fact, i'm astounded to see someone from a music background succeed with flying colours where professional writers have failed many times over.
i highly encourage you to try this game

At first glance, Undertale seems like any other 8-bit point-and-click adventure game with RPG elements. But upon playing it, I found out that there was far more to it than first meets the eye.
Undertale is a game with an amazing story, and a great cast of characters. At first, your very presence in the game seems to be shrouded by mystery as you ask questions like "Who am I?" and "How did I get here?" As time goes on, and you continue the story, you'll slowly discover more and more how everything ties together and falls into place.
Along the way, you meet some really awesome critters with great personalities. And based on your choices of how to interact with them, you can get some pretty wild outcomes!
Additionally, there are some cool little secrets, easter eggs, and mind games hidden along the way, with the ever so annoying tease that will really just make you throw up your hands and say "What the actual stink was that?!?!"
While there are several variations, there are three main outcomes, each of which require a certain playstyle throughout your playthrough of the game. Neutral, Pacifist, and Genocide. Each of these requires you to do a certain number of tasks in a certain order, and if you wish to learn how to do this correctly, I suggest you look up some guides here on Steam. Though, just be warned, spoilers may be present, and the game is very story based.
Also, the game tends to break the 4th wall, and does it well. It reminded me a little of my time playing Doki Doki Literature Club in this way, though (in my opinion) Undertale does it better.
While most puzzles/minigames in this game are pretty straightforward and not too difficult, there are two boss battles in this game that are HARD. I'm talking hours of practive, learn the patterns hard. But dang, are they rewarding to get through.
Things I really loved about the game are as follows:
-Great characters
-Amazing story
-Bonus content w/ lore tied in that requires multiple playthroughs
-Fun mini-game concept
-Challenging bosses
-Old school themed 8-bit graphics
-Easter eggs
-A great sense of humor (including breaking the 4th wall)
-An innovative take on a timeless genre
A couple of things I thought maybe could of used a little improvement:
-All the gameplay is based on the minigames in which you interact with monsters. While there is some variety to this, it can become a little repetitive.
-This game is perfectly built for a Battle Royale mode, but there is none present (totally joking)
If you like games that are richly story based, innovate on timeless concepts, and provide a fun little adventure over the course of a few hours, then I heartily recommend Undertale!

Before I get into the game, I'll start off by saying that my friends played it almost as soon as it came out. One of them maybe even helped Kickstart it, I don't know for sure. I thought they were cringy as hell. They bought it for me, but I refused to play it for like a year and a half or something like that. I thought it was gonna be so overrated and that it was going to bore me to sleep. Hell, I really only played it because I wanted some of the trading cards that would come with it so I could get CS:GO cases. I honestly thought I'd just play it and be done.
But,
I have never been more wrong in my entire life
This game literally changed my outlook on life in general. The story is amazing, so long as you keep an open mind. The soundtrack was phenomenal. The songs perfectly portrayed what was going on in the story, especially when big story events happened. My only recommendation for playing this game would be to spare every monster before you try any of the other ways to play. If you're anything like me, it will change you. Over all, Undertale has become one of my favorite story-driven games ever. I haven't felt this attached to a fictional story in years. Undertale's fanbase is cringy. Hell, you probably think I'm cringy just by reading this. However, if you are in any way curious about this game, just try it. Go into it keeping an open mind and maybe you'll love it as much as I did.
tl;dr I thought this game was gonna be trash, but it was actually really good and I loved it.

Wow.
Just, wow.
I'm at a loss of words. This game...
...It's an absolute MASTERPIECE.
For my loyal readers, do you remember my Shovel Knight craze last year?
Undertale is my Shovel Knight of 2015.
Graphics
The graphics are a simple 8-bit style, and although it's considered "generic" because of the whole "8 bit indie game made by one guy" sort of thing, this game uses it properly. I know, that seems really weird, but it's true. If you play the game and take a certain route, the final boss WILL blow your mind with the visuals. Not much here to say, it's not what's supposed to make this game so noteworthy, but it's still acceptable nonetheless.
Gameplay
Undertale is a lot like Earthbound in many ways, the most notable trait being the turn based combat and how it's portrayed. Nowadays, LOTS of games have opportunities where you can spare or kill a certain character and decide their fate. Their flaw, however, is that the said death often is just shrugged off, both in the game's world AND in real life. Undertale takes this concept and cranks it up a notch, leaving literally every single character's fate in your hands. You can go for a pacifist run and kill no one, and this is the one I would highly recommend going for if you do decide to purchase this masterpiece. There's also the neutral ending, which is the most common of the bunch but has one of the most creative final bosses I've ever seen in video games. I won't spoil much, but it will BLOW your mind, you can trust me on that. There's also the genocide run, which is incredibly difficult to pull off because of how emotionally difficult it is to actually kill this lovable cast of monsters. The combat itself is like Earthbound's, as said earlier. This being said, Undertale takes yet another step forward, adding bullet hell and platforming to the mix and blends the two perfectly, making the game far more exciting, while keeping the original RPG elements.
Story
This is the very core of why Undertale is such an unforgettable experience. Of course, though, you shouldn't be shocked at this point, because most of the internet will agree with me on that. The cast of characters is so diverse and unique, each one having traits to make them likable or the one you'd love to kill on a genocide run. For example, you have Sans, my favorite of the bunch. He's a laid back, prankster, and easy going skeleton who has a brother named Papyrus. What Papyrus lacks in intelligence, he makes up for with a big heart for humans. You also have Flowey, who immediately will creep you out because of how ruthless he is. As for the plot itself, it's one big emotional rollercoaster you would want to ride over and over and over again. It has its hilarious moments, since the writing is surprisingly well done, while it has its sad moments, too. What takes the cake on all of this, though, is that it literally makes you rethink everything you knew about video games. The fourth wall is also broken often, and this is done in the most clever and creative ways. It's like Kid Icarus: Uprising, except Undertale does it far better. I almost forgot, too, but every action in this game will be remembered by the characters, long after you actually beat it. People have called this game a "sentient being" and I can actually agree with them on that. Trust me, Undertale is literally perfect for storytelling, and I won't be shocked if you cried a bit. It's hard not to, and with such a unique cast of lovable characters, it further justifies my point.
Audio
I have a friend who also loves Undertale, and the one thing he seems to point out about it is the soundtrack. I can't blame him, because it's really catchy. Remember how I said this game was my Shovel Knight of 2015? I wasn't kidding about that, it has the awesome soundtrack to go with it. You have Bonetrousle, the sinister, yet lighthearted and catchy tune that fits Papyrus. There's the Spider Dance, Muffet's theme. This theme is a lot more evil but far more catchy, and is one of my personal favorites. The king of the bunch, however, is one that didn't directly originate from Undertale: Megalovania. Sans' theme is slowly becoming an iconic boss theme, as it has been used in two different times in the past, and this variation is definitely my favorite of the three. You also have some humorous songs, namely the Dogsong. I won't get too in-depth with that one, but I need to say this now: GEEEET DUNKED ON! There is no voice acting, but why does that even matter? This game doesn't need it. Overall, this game has some high quality music, and I love it that way.
Replayability
As I said earlier, this game has multiple endings. Want to know what makes it interesting, though? The characters will remember EVERYTHING you've done. I mean that, too. Mess with the game's files and try to beat it that way, I dare you. With the multiple endings, the replayability is far more dependent on you. If you have no soul, you'll probably try and do a genocide run while doing the other two runs as well. Maybe you'll try and do a pacifist one so you don't have to go through the pain of killing anyone, then do a neutral, and finish with a genocide ending. Just remember, EVERY choice will be remembered permanently.
Verdict

Late to this. Music is classic and lovely. Story is interesting and keeps you going. Combat (or lack thereof) is fun and challenging enough at times. Characters are interesting for the most part. Good, not too long game, worth milking most of its content out of if you can.

Undertale teaches a lesson to some modern AAA games: Good games are all about establishing a strong connection with the player.

I remember how I avoided this game like the plague, the fandom and those cringe compilations really did a huge number to make me dislike the game even tho I never played it, in addition YouTube and all social media platforms were full with Undertale content, youtube was recommending playthroughs and boss fight videos basicaly spoiling the entire game for me. Now years later, when I noticed that I completely forgot everything about this game I finally decided it was the perfect time to play it, and boy oh boy was that the best idea I ever had.
Where do I even start, Undertale is an incredible game, it made me care about fictional characters like no other game has ever done. The story is fascinating, the world building is well done, the characters are unique and well defined and have genuinely made me laugh multiple times throughout my playthrough, and to this game’s credit the art style fits a minimalistic style that I love and appreciate and gets elevated by the wonderful work of art that is its soundtrack.
This game aged like a fine wine, it's enjoyable and entertaining and has done something that a few games can do, it made me care. I played it by following the advice my friend Bigby gave to me, which was “To fully enjoy the game, do not kill the monsters and bosses” and he is 100% correct, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.
Consider myself a fan now Toby, looking forward to Deltarune.

♥♥♥♥. This is a tough one to write, not at all like my usual reviews. I'm just sort of rambling and gushing because there's so much to say about Undertale... and I can't SAY anything without spoiling the experience for you!
Yes, you!
Buy this game, don't watch anything on YouTube about it, don't read the Undertale subreddit or any wikis, don't even read this review (though I've avoided spoilers, of course) – just seal yourself into a room with a computer and some kind of makeshift toilet, play it to completion, clean yourself for the love of God, and come back.
...
Hero? Villain? Or something wholly other?
The year isn't out and there are some huge releases yet to come, but that being said...
Undertale is a GOTY contender, indie or otherwise.
It's the best RPG in a year of amazing RPG releases.
It's the funniest, most well-written game in, well, a very long time.
It's the most genuinely heartwarming (and incredibly dark) game in, well, a very long time.
It's challenging but surmountable, given a little skill and a whole lot of determination.
And it's also the most mind-♥♥♥♥♥ game in, well, a very long time, in an entirely unique way! Sure, you can compare it to Metal Gear's Psycho Mantis or Eternal Darkness' sanity meter effects, though that won't do Undertale's special, thoughtful mechanics justice.
But I digress.
You play as a tiny, gender-neutral child with bad fashion sense who falls down a mountain into a cavernous underworld filled with all sorts of fantastical monsters – all of whom have been banished there after losing a war with humankind. Now you have to get yourself back to the sunny, human-friendly overworld.
Fairly standard so far, complete with the pretty concept art cutscenes and humdrum hero origin tale.
Then five minutes pass and all your expectations just sort of fly out the proverbial window screaming, never to return.
Like, ever.
Thus begins your six, seven, or eight hour (initial) journey into Undertale. You'll encounter all sorts of wacky, zany characters and monsters, puzzles, traditional RPG-type environments... loaded with obstacles standing between you and the finish line. And it's up to you decide how you're going to approach the aforementioned zany characters and monsters. Sure, you can do the traditional “kill indiscriminately” thing, but that's just one solution. See, Undertale is an RPG where you can beat the whole damn thing without killing anyone!
Like, you can hug your way through the entire affair!
Easy enough, right?
And you can always just reload a save if you screw up, right?
…
Anyhoo, combat mechanics are... it's hard to describe. It's like a traditional turn-based RPG combat system only, well, those expectations all went screaming out that window I mentioned earlier. Your heart appears in a window below the enemy you're currently dealing with and you have to dodge bullet-hell-style attacks... most of the time anyway. Even after your old expectations are but a distant memory, newly established expectations go flying out screaming too.
It's a little weird.
If fighting is your style you'll have that option, of course. Presented with a flashing bar, hit the sweet spot and you'll do the most possible damage; rinse and repeat. You can access items, check on the enemy's stats and what have you, pursue a peaceful resolution... lots of options, and every monster is a little different.
Well, not a little different – incredibly different, incredible variety! And figuring out their ticks, traits, fears, and dreams is all part of the fun puzzle that is Undertale.
But there's more!
Undertale's music is fabulous – in that wonderfully synthetic, retro way. Every character has a “voice,” every monster, region, and special event has a theme, and when appropriate, the music is chillingly absent. It's the best part of this game - beside the top-notch writing.
I said every character has a “voice,” referring to the musical tones playing during dialogue. But they also each have their own VOICE, you understand? There's the overly protective mother, the bad jokester, the lacking-any-self-awareness fella... but even then it's just scratching the surface. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ emote! These sprites have some Shakespearean depth that becomes more apparent with each hour, each playthrough.
You'll care for them, whether you want to or not.
…
What else is there to say? I laughed out loud two dozen times or so, I lost count; I nearly cried at least five times, I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumpscared more than once, I had an existential crisis, and I'd do it all over again.
And again.
And again.
There's, like, nothing I can even complain about! Were some of the fights tedious, long-winded? Yeah, but I might be biased because I wanted to just enjoy more dialogue, more strange interactions, more environments. Were some of the references lost on me (particularly Anime stuff)? Sure, but that's what Google is for.
Undertale just is... objectively good.
Objectively great.
It's an experience like Shadow of the Colossus, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Half-Life, Red Dead Redemption, Dark Souls, EarthBound... a little, unassuming 2D RPG game released in 2015 stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the best games of all time – one I initially judged by its cover and ignored.
I'm glad I deleted that particular corrupted save file and started fresh, because missing out on this game would have left a little heart-shaped void that I might have never filled.

I first played Undertale 6 and a half years ago. I was 11 years old and I went into it mostly blind. It was the first single player story based game I had ever played. My games library prior to Undertale was pretty much just Minecraft and Castle Crashers. My 11 year old mind was absolutely blown away by this amazing game. I remember laughing at the silly comedy, falling in love with the characters, and I remember very clearly being TERRIFIED when Flowey coldly called me out for killing Toriel and resetting to save her life. I quickly fell head first into the fandom. For a few years this game was EVERYTHING to me.
Around the time Deltarune Ch1 came out, (ironically) my interest had waned. Then two years after that, Covid hit and I went right back around to it. It was comforting and familiar and it was my lifeline during the pandemic.
All this to say... Undertale is very important to me. I recently replayed the game after receiving it as a gift, and I was able to rediscover everything that made this game be hot glued to my soul. Something that has been lost in the fandom, between the theorizing and the multiplying AUs and the memes is the HEART that went into this game. This game is full of so much heart. It's about love and choosing kindness despite everything, about granting mercy whenever possible, and friendship, and love, love, love. Oh the things we do for love. The love of the sibling you'd do anything for. The love of the children who have gone. The love of the kingdom drowning in sorrow.
Toby Fox masterfully weaves a story of tragedy and hope. A story where people are selfish and cowardly and heartbroken, where people make mistakes again and again, and despite all that they deserve a second chance, and a third, and a fourth, and as many chances as it takes to do the right thing. He presents us with these flawed characters and shows us how to love them not despite but because of those flaws. Despite the simplistic graphics, he somehow blurs the line between real life and video game to such a degree that I can never bring myself to reset after achieving the happiest ending. These little clumps of pixels have wormed their way into my heart and are there to stay permanently.
I could wax poetic for days about the other things that make this game great. Toby's attention to detail to such a minute degree that I'm still finding out new things 7 years after the game's release. The secrets hidden in the code. The foreshadowing and mysteries that plague the fandom to this day. The million little dialogue differences based on your actions, and the numerous endings to the game. But I think I've said it all. This game is not the best game I've ever played, not by a long shot. But due to the way the story has impacted me, it is my favourite. I hope I can make something that impacts someone even a fraction of how this game has impacted me.
Good night.

To be honest, I played the game because of the memes and I really didn't expect how good the game was.
The game is way better than I imagined. I don't usually play games like Undertale, but I'm glad I played it.
You should play it! ^^
Posted: September 27, 2015
You should totally play this if you enjoy;
-Earthbound/Mother/similar genre of old school RPG's
-Amazing soundtracks
- >internet references
-Severe emotional trauma
-Crippling paranoia about everything you've done and will potentially do in your miserable span of existence
TL;DR made me an emotional sobbing mess, so all in all 10 outta 10 would delete my biological save file and experience this ♥♥♥♥ all over again.
