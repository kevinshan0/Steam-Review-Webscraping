Loved it so much I showed my wife.
She loved it so much she bought her own copy. This was her first videogame.
She loved it so much she spent over a 100 in-game hours trying to learn how to play videogames.
She loved it so much she, the person who rage quits Little Big Planet, stuck with it until she beat the game. Twice.
10/10 would give anything to find another game like this for me and wife.

This piece of art right here?
Game of the year for someone like me who loves platformers, a great soundtrack, and is a big fan of Metroidvania style games? Oh yeah.
Game of the year for everyone else? Maybe!
Let me tell you some things about this game:
+Offers a lengthy adventure (I completed 100% in 28 hours and there is still more I could do if I wish)
+The combat is so tight! Not only are the mechanics themselves simple and crisp but they are also super deep with things like charms which you can equip to give certain abilities and other classic staples in these types of games like a dash / double jump / wall jump
+The controls are very fine tuned and it always feels like it was my fault if I died and not simply poor game design
+The bosses are sick AF and they all have really cool moves / patterns / styles to them
+The game manages to never feel linear at all, it has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world (Hallownest it is called) and leaves the exploring up to you
+The Soundtrack is bomb. These indie company hits lately always offer a memorable and groovy soundtrack and this game is no different. It offers a few solid themes for many of the fight scenes as well as beautiful atmospheric soundtracks which fit the areas so nicely
+Oh and did I mention the game looks beautiful? Go check images of this game right now like the area "The City of Tears" and just marvel at the amount of detail put into the scenery. For a game this big the art style and attention to detail is truly impressive
My real only problem with this game is not even so much a problem at all as it is a warning: to those of you out there on the more casual end who may struggle with difficulty in this genre you have been warned! While the game is mostly pretty forgiving with save points in most general areas I will say some of the combat gets pretty tough. For someone like me I enjoyed it thoroughly as I felt the difficulty was just the right amount and it never felt cheap or unfair.
Fot those out there who aren't as into these type of games as much I feel Hollow Knight is a great game to start you into the genre. The price is very reasonable, and it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype. Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!

I bought this game because my four-year-old daughter liked the creepy skeleton bug man.
I'm 40, and for the last 34 years or so I have consistently sucked at any game demanding any degree of speed or coordination. I remember the first Castlevania and the first Metroid and I remember sucking at both of them. I play RPGs or turn-based strategy games like Civ. I had never played a souls-like before and I had no idea what I was getting into. This game is hard. as. hell. When you beat it, the game congratulates you on your "achievement" and I felt that word in my bones. Now, 250 hours later I can beat AbsRad on ascended. I'm at 109% with only pantheon 5 to go. I beat the path of pain and I'm considering putting that on CV. I think this game taught my kid that parents also struggle and must persevere to accomplish their goals... But, I enjoyed every minute of the grind because this game is a masterpiece, from it's level and art design to the music to the cryptic lore. This is one of those games that reminds me why I love gaming, and I'm glad I got to share something so special with my daughter. We can't wait for Silksong.

112% BABY!!!!
Posted: December 11, 2018
Yes, you're seeing it correctly. I have 300+ hours* on this game.
That being said, I played through about 250 of those hours, and I can confidently say that this is, and might always be, my favorite game.
I'll start with the cons:
- There is a LOT of roaming around and exploration in this game. Although this can appeal to some people, it can definitely make you feel lost and a little frustrated trying to find out where to go (especially after Greenpath, at least for me).
- Many, many points in the game where you'll get stuck for literal hours trying to get past. If you tilt easily or are an ardent completionist, you might have a bad time. You will probably never get to the Land of Storms.
- Sometimes, the movement mechanics can feel really unfair, especially at the most difficult platforming sections (WHY DOES MONARCH WINGS SEND YOU DOWN FIRST!?), although I think learning and mastering the mechanics is all just part of the game.
- Although I've never played Dark Souls (I'll get to it eventually), I've heard that this game's story feels very similar. Not sure how this is a con, but felt that it was important to mention.
- Will destroy your Mac's battery. Seriously.
Now time for the pros. I'll admit I'm a little biased, but I think there's a reason this is my favorite game.
First of all, this game is massive. My first 112% of this game took me a little under 100 hours, if not actually 100 hours. Now, every other playthrough of this game that I've done took me significantly less time, but considering that this game was made by a team of three people and that this game is a quarter the price of Dark Souls, I'd say that the amount of content in this game is remarkable. And that content isn't filler content. Few rooms in this game are. Almost every room will have something new in it, either a new enemy, a new mechanic/upgrade, a piece of the story, or a secret. Since its initial release, three free content packs have come out, along with one "major update," with a paid DLC coming in 2019**. Every one of the content packs released so far has had so much new content, including some of the most difficult bosses in the game. Hidden Dreams came out with bosses that, if beaten enough, can kill you with a single blow. The Grimm Troupe arrived with a dream variant on a new, already-difficult boss that took me over three hours of attempts to beat, along with the hardest platforming that you might ever come across. Finally, Gods and Glory Godmaster arrived, adding a bossrush mode, exciting variants on old bosses that made them even more difficult, two more endings, and a boss that easily overthrew the Grimm Troupe boss as the hardest enemy this game has to offer.
Speaking of enemies, the bosses are tough, well-designed, and the learning curve for them is quite good. I can say that I can count the number of bosses that I actually disliked on one hand, and that's being pretty harsh for a few of them. And there are so many, and so many variants!
The atmosphere of this game is incredible. The music is perfect, the color pallet for everything in each area is spot on, and they all contribute a part to the amazing story. So immersive and so fleshed out. It looks and sounds so good (bless you, Christopher Larken, bless you).
The story is developed through the game so well. At first, the story seems to be very baseline, just little bits of lore to piece together. You don't even know who your character is, although you just assume you're the Hollow Knight. But slowly, you learn about the devastating events that eventually leads to this beautiful world's demise. There are five endings, and once you learn that there was more to do in order to fix this broken kingdom, you feel compelled to keep going.
It amazes me how relatively unknown this game is. It's so incredibly cheap for what it gets you, and is one of the richest worlds you will ever dive into. You'll become a much better player just by getting through the game, and you're likely to love nearly every moment of it. This is the only game that I've encountered that has significant portion of its player base sad that they didn't pay MORE for this game in order to support the developers. An amazing world with an even better soundtrack, I highly recommend this game above all others.
Updates:
*whoops looks like I made it to 400+.
**So turns out that Team Cherry, the genius company behind this game, decided not to make the DLC... THEY'RE INSTEAD MAKING AN ENTIRELY NEW GAME IN ITS PLACE. This is also a pro for buying the game. SUPPORT THIS AMAZING COMPANY.

I've been playing video games since I was 8. I've had good times with some of the greatest titles ever made.
This is THE best game I've ever played.
I robbed the developer by only paying $20 for such a masterpiece.

TL;DR
It is the ultimate Metroidvania with a rich setting, extremely satisfying combat, responsive controls, and last but not least, a unique world to explore that feels like a real adventure.
Full Review
I think I owe this game a detailed review. Let me start it by telling you that I quit playing games and even gifted my various gaming accounts to my cousin-in-law a couple of years ago. I did it because I lost any interest in games whatsoever. I don‚Äôt remember how and when I acquired Hollow Knight; what I remember is the feeling of wonderment I experienced when I launched the game. I did it on my old Mac that was not even suited for playing games. The feeling was so strong, so avid; it lasted to the very end of my several walkthroughs one hundred in-game hours later. This is how I found interest in games again; this is why I consider Hollow Knight one of the best games ever made (and probably the best Metroidvania to this date.) It gave me what I thought I had lost forever ‚Äì that childlike feel of the big adventure. Now, let‚Äôs talk about the details.
The fantastic bug world of Hollow Knight grips you right away. You arrive at the fabled kingdom of Hallownest in its decline, without any memory of who you are or where you are heading; an empty vessel. At first, you have no clue of your purpose; there is no map in your inventory ‚Äì you have to acquire it later. You proceed blindly into an unknown and strangely hostile environment because you feel some weird connection to this place. Something is not right; you see it clearly with your black holes of eyes, and you try to solve the mystery. With each step you take, with each new character you interact with, the beautiful story slowly unfolds before your voiceless hero. You don‚Äôt speak at all; the only thing you possess to cast your will is your sharp needle and fossilized bug shells called Geo that serve as a local currency.
The combat is tight, diverse, and highly customizable with different spells and charms. Do you remember those classic games where you have to play with a slow, clumsy character that is efficient only when your timing is precise to the automation? Forget them! Hollow Knight gives you the pleasure of fighting how you want and how you enjoy. Of course, you still have to time your movements right, but it all comes with more versatility and a lot more satisfaction. It is so addicting that even fighting mobs in the same zones, again and again, is not a chore.
Controls are very efficient. There are many moves, power-ups, combos, spells, charms to learn and use, and everything is easy to pick up. Later in the game, you roam the vast world of Hallownest like a deadly ninja-warlock-parkourist. As with combat, the movement (after some progress) is also very satisfying.
The art style and music are masterpieces in themselves. The art style is very distinctive; it has a powerful gothic feeling to it, which looks unbelievably majestic in a world of militant bugs. The music of Christopher Larkin is equally grand. Everyone praises orchestral music in Ori and the Blind Forest / Ori and the Will of the Wisps, although I prefer Hollow Knight‚Äôs solemn and melancholic compositions. They sound so soft, so gentle...like a lullaby or a fairy tale. It oddly fits the gameplay.
This is one of the few games I will remember and love deeply for my whole life, probably with ugly nostalgic sentiments along the line. It is one thing when you experience this kind of bond with something when you are a kid. It is another thing when the creation of human imagination manages to touch you similarly when you are long past your teenage years. It means a lot to me. Thank you, Team Cherry. You did something truly exceptional here.

Short Review
Read this if you just want to hear what I think about the game.
Hollow Knight is simply one of the most unique Metroidvania titles on the market. It features a combat system that isn't very complex, but still incredibly satisfying. The art style is charming and filled with dread at the same time, making it one of the most visually appealing. The interwoven areas of Hallownest are as rewarding to explore as they're exciting, with each area offering something new, both visually and mechanically. Even the few bugs can't ruin the momentum of this masterpiece of a game.
Pros and Cons
+ Satisfying combat with incredible enemy variety
+ Absolutely stunning art style unlike anything you've seen before
+ Rewarding exploration and interwoven areas
+ Beautifully sad soundtrack with a unique track for almost each area in the game
- Some rare bugs with the controls
RATING: Exceptional

Full Review
Read this if you want all the details.
Hollow Knight is a 2D Metroidvania set in Hallownest, a land of bugs hidden beneath the surface of the earth.
Simple, yet complex
Hollow Knight's combat system is without a doubt not one of the more complex ones. You start with only one normal attack and one spell, functioning as your special move. As you progress through the game, you'll slowly get more special moves, known as Nail Arts, but I didn't find myself using them very often since you first had to charge them before being able to unleash them upon your foes. Yet, somehow Hollow Knight manages to pull off the near-impossible: to make its combat simple, yet complex. While this term is quite contradictory, It's how I would best describe the combat. I'm going to compare it to Dark Souls. If you've played any of those games, you'll know that the range of attacks you can perform is very limited. Where these games get their complexity from lies in the moves of the enemies, all of which have unique movesets, with each move being telegraphed, allowing for the player to counter it before it's too late. The same can be said for Hollow Knight. I was impressed at the sheer number of different enemies since I went in knowing that the game was made by a very small team of people. According to the game itself, there are over 100 different enemy types. Sure, some of them are different variations of one kind, but most of them are unique. This creates an experience that never gets tiresome, even though the game isn't that complex. There are still some possibilities for those who want to specialize in certain character builds. The game offers you a set of Charms that you can equip to get different bonuses. These could be extra range for your weapon or a shield that protects you while you're healing yourself. Charms can be found by exploring the environments of Hallownest. There's a lot of them, and this causes the exploration to be rewarding and worth your time.
It's challenging, and that's a good thing
It's not a Souls-like if it isn't challenging. The game truly lives up to this requirement, with bosses that will absolutely test your patience. The satisfaction once you beat that boss you've been stuck on for the last few hours is, like always, incomparable to anything else. I found the bosses to be surprisingly consistent. I expected that there would be your usual irritating and unfair bosses, but I didn't feel like I encountered any of that kind during my entire playthrough. Every single boss felt fair, with telegraphed moves and a moveset that wasn't too hard to master.
The combat isn't the only thing you'll find yourself struggling with. There's a lot of platforming sequences in the game, some of which are easy, others brutally hard, requiring high precision and well-planned moves. I'm not one who've got a big knack for platformers, so I did sometimes find myself challenged by these sequences, but they never seemed unfair.
The beauty of desolation
If you've ever heard anything about Hollow Knight, you should be familiar with its charming art style. It's visually breathtaking and unique, distinguishing Hollow Knight from any other game. It gives the game a feel of dread while also having a soothing, almost cozy feeling to it. I adored the design of the characters; friend and foe alike. Instead of featuring humans, Hollow Knight takes a unique turn, having bugs serve as the main race of the game. The game fully takes advantage of this, with character designs that can only be described as exceptionally creative. Everything is simply so beautiful, and it makes you want to stop up just to look at every little detail put into the world. Each animation feels precise and just as weighty as it needs to be. Everything from the attacks of you and your enemies to the movement looks incredible. Combine this with an almost depressingly sad soundtrack, including a unique theme for almost every area in the game, and you've got a game that nails everything to do with presentation.
Worthwhile exploration
Hallownest consists of a wide range of both visually and mechanically unique areas. Each area feels refreshingly unique, with their individual enemy types, color schemes and platforming mechanics. All of the areas are intertwoven into one complete world, with a Metroidvania level design. There's multiple ways to access each area, and they're all satisfyingly connected. Inspired by the bonfires of Dark Souls, resting at a bench will fully replenish your health, and allow you to equip and unequip your charms. These benches are far and few between, and it's reliefing whenever you find one. Some places also require special abilities to be accessed. These are often found later in the game off the beaten path, forcing you to take your time exploring carefully, if you want to see everything the game has to offer. It's always satisfying when you finally find the ability you needed to get to an unaccesible area in one of the earlier locations you've visited. You can also upgrade both your health, amount of SOUL (the essence you use to perform special moves and heal yourself), and the damage of your weapon. This is done by finding a specific number of the required item needed to upgrade them. Just like charms, these items are hidden throughout all of Hallownest, and are often easy to miss.
While I have completed the game, there's still a lot left for me to do. I still need to defeat the bosses I missed, fully upgrade my equipment, and uncover the remaining secrets of the game. I look forward to continuing my journey, as Hollow Knight simply is incredible.
The bugs of Hallownest
Unfortunately, Hollow Knight doesn't come without some rare, yet irritating bugs. (Yes, that header pun was intentional). I encountered a bug where moving the joystick would open the map and begin scrolling to the left. This happened a total of 2 times throughout a 60-hour playthrough, so it was very rare, but still annoying. The game also happened to not register my jumps a few times, but I'm not sure if it was a problem with my controller, or the game. These are the only two cases of bugs and glitches I remember. They didn't ruin the experience at all, but they were still irritating to encounter.
For this review, I tried experimenting with giving each section a header to make the review easier to read. Please let me know what you think.

There aren't many games that have cast a longer shadow over the industry than Dark Souls, and much like what you'll find lurking within them it's been a bit of a curse. Too many indie games have been overtuned to provide a similarly punishing experience, narratives have been undercooked to mimic the subtle storytelling, and action has been slowed to a crawl to imitate the methodical combat. But some titles have taken the right bits of inspiration and mixed them with their own brew of mechanics, and from just such a concoction you will find Hollow Knight. And in many ways, the mix Team Cherry has come up with is a richer taste than what inspired it.
Hollow Knight is the tale of a little bug in a big, dark, scary world of bugs. It's bugs all the way down, you see; the kingdom of Hallownest was once a great and powerful society, spread across deep warrens beneath the surface. But something went wrong long ago and the kingdom fell silent. Now only the tiny hamlet of Dirtmouth remains to mark its location, though recently bugs have found themselves drawn to the lost kingdom in search of something. You will follow them down there, meet them, battle them and the unknown denizens, and change the fate of the cursed kingdom forever.
Pretty heavy stuff, right? Hollow Knight gets that, and that's one of its first and most prominent achievements. The tone this title strikes is both unique and flawless, an unexpected mix of charm, despair, humor, and dread. You've probably noticed already that your little dude is absolutely adorable, nipping along with his little white mask and nail. The other bugs nice enough to speak to you are often just as cute, but sometimes have sinister edges to them, or in a few cases are downright creepy. Friendly critters may crack jokes or help you out, while others relay ominous portends or warn you of the many dangers in and around Hallownest.
This balance carries on to the environments in a big way. The game world is massive for a metroidvania, and each area has a distinct style and atmosphere that hits all the right notes to evoke powerful reactions. From the first area of dark caves and ruins you may end up in a lush grotto of vines and creatures, a pleasant change until you realize the water is acidic and every bush may hide terrible dangers. Or you could descend into the caverns of potent fungi, with mysterious, bulbous foes that must be approached with great caution. Later journeys take you to decaying cities, silent graveyards, bustling coliseums, desolate wastes, and two of the most horrifyingly oppressive places I have ever visited in a video game. I'm not kidding here, Hollow Knight has topped titles from Half-life to SOMA in crafting locations that give me relentless anxiety.
Another achievement worth mentioning is how Hollow Knight can craft such an atmosphere without hobbling the player in how they approach it. Part of the Dark Souls experience is trundling around at a slow jog, fighting battles and dodging traps at a measured pace. Team Cherry wisely elected to ignore this aspect of their inspiration, instead making your little knight swift, nimble, and refreshingly responsive. The controls here are tight, allowing you to execute your dashes and sword swings with ease as you dance around bugs both great and small, airborne and grounded, armed and fanged. At no point was I frustrated with the pace at which I could move about, and the fluid motion made the elaborate and creative battles against bosses and larger enemies all the more enjoyable.
As a metroidvania there's a wealth of hidden items and powers to scrounge up across the world as well. Some are common pieces of the genre like health and magic upgrades, weapon skills and wall climbing and such. But even here there are unique implementations, like one of your earliest powers being essentially unlimited horizontal flight. Uncovering this treasure so early on feels incredibly liberating and exciting, but also reveals to you just how important verticality is to the game. You can further augment your movement and combat with charms that can extend your sword reach, change how you move when hit or attacking, or grant you all sorts of additional effects. I will admit a little disappointment here at how essential some charms are over others and how the limited slots for them tend to keep me from experimenting much, though.
I suppose I could gripe about a few other annoyances, like the rare bug I get where my charged attacks don't work, or how spread out the fast travel is. That latter one is a bit of a pain in truth, because the stations used for fast travel tend to be quite far from points of interest. You certainly won't be relying on them as much as you would Castlevania warp rooms or Dark Souls bonfire warps. The map is another aspect that could be a drag, but honestly I love it. You don't fill in new areas of the map until you reach a save point, and to get a map at all you have to locate an amateur cartographer in each area. He tends to be near one of the logical entrances and has audio and visual cues to lead you to him, so there's a bit of tension in each new locale as you seek him out.
It's details like the map that make me love the game more, really. Hallownest isn't just a maze to run around, it's a functioning world with its own rules and requirements. The things Hollow Knight asks you to do are never unreasonable and fit with the dark and unusual tone of the places you visit. Nothing is out of place here, and it all works in concert to immerse you in this strange world of bugs and mysticism. The characters and locations are far more memorable to me than those of similar games, in large part because they can be funny or creepy or adorable and still fill their role in a seamless narrative. There's a lot to unpack about Hallownest, but instead of just resting on riddles this game makes you WANT to puzzle it out.
On top of everything that Hollow Knight does right, it looks and sounds absolutely breathtaking. The hand-drawn aesthetic gives the enemies and environments an extra spark of life, complimenting the strong lines and flat colors with impressive animated details. The environments in particular are labors of love that bring together careful linework, bold lighting, and rich particle effects to make them feel deep and authentic. And the sound design does just as well, with appropriately subtle, melancholy melodies and impactful effects. There's so much going on here that it baffles me how it could all work together so perfectly and yet it does, on and on for easily 20 hours or more. Hollow Knight does what few games manage to do, take clear inspiration from classics and find its own way to surpass them.

Dear Team Cherry, Please for the love of god release Silksong so I can stop playing this complete, Masterpiece of a game. A game that is challenging, atmospheric, and beautiful in character design. The soundtrack is remarkable and reflects the air with such an artful design. Definitely a must-play for everybody.
5/5.

Why Should You Buy Hollow Knight?
- Insanely fun game.
- Dirt cheap, especially on sales.
- The devs are super nice people.
- The devs released four massive DLCs. For free.
- Not an Epic Store exclusive.
- It's super fun.
- You'd be supporting Australia's indie game industry.
- Amazing artstyle.
- Phenomenal music.
- Seriously, just buy it.

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Seven percent pleasure
Sixty percent pain
And a 112% reason to play the game.

Spoiler free review, with a short and long version:
TLDR version
Buy Hollow Knight if:
‚úÖ you love hard 2D platformers with a Metroidvania vibe
‚úÖ you're seeking for a hard challenge, whether you're gonna 100% the game or not
‚úÖ you're looking for a long, slow(?) paced game, that will require at least 20 hours to be finished
‚úÖ you like to explore and experiment several ways to combat an excellent enemy variety
‚úÖ you love to hunt lore elements, secret areas and clear challenges
‚úÖ you fancy games with a gorgeous handwritten art (check the screenshot below)
Don't buy Hollow Knight if:
‚ùå you're looking for a "casual" and light hearted gaming experience
‚ùå you're looking for a "Ori and the Blind Forest" "replacement""
‚ùå you don't like playing with a controller
‚ùå you don't enjoy being left alone without a quest / main plot map marker
‚ùå you don't like looking for secondary quests and objectives
Time required to finish the main game: 20 hours (without a game guide)
Time required to complete the main game at 100%: 32 - 35 hours
Time required to get all the achievements: 70+ hours
Verdict: 9.5/10, masterpiece (read below if interested to know more and why)
Detailed version
1- HK absolutely deserves its price tag, as the game soundtrack, the boss fights, the optional content and the game locations are insanely deep, well designed and meaningful (check my screenshot down below - no spoilers)
2- The map is H-U-G-E and you will be able to backtrack it with a nice and upgradable map, with the help of fast travel skills and mechanics, extremely useful to get to the most hidden (and beautiful) areas of the game
3- The main plot deals with a grim topic, however be prepared to be amused by some cool, (sometimes cheerful) and pictoresque NPCs that will certainly have a place in your heart for a while
4- Every area and every secret location, shrine, temple etc. is carefully shown to the player in a remarkable and unforgettable way (i won't spoil them here, feel free to check community's screeshots though), allowing the player to savor every area and to get empathically tuned with it, even from a lore perspective
5- HK shows an insane enemy and boss variety (100+) with a curious and "lore-bestiary" included
6- a new free DLC was added on the 4th of August with additional content: 2 new bosses, 1 new stag station and one teleport mechanic
7- every cosmetic aspect of the game (even the game menu) is well designed and carefully "chiseled", just to show (no spoilers-there's even a Kickstarter area as a tribute to the initial backers!!):

However, be aware that:
a) enemies are skilled and extremely vicious; they will prevent you from doing you usual set of moves often trying (and with
success most of time) to anticipate and neutralize you without any mercy
b) platforming sessions are challenging but frequent and won't forgive too many mistakes and "slips" while completing them
c) playing HK without a controller isn't a smart idea to say the least, as there are too many commands to be mastered and used
d) the game is not friendly for casual players, as enemies are unforgiving and all the combat/movement abilities need to be ALL MASTERED AT THE SAME TIME
To sum up:
Buy this game ONLY if you want to play a hard, gorgeous platforming masterpiece that won't take your hand when you're feeling lost without knowing which your next game destination will be.

Do I recommend this? Maybe.
It's gorgeous, no doubt about it, and very well done.
However, I'm not a great gamer. I enjoy video games and play them a few times a week, but I'm not particularly good at them.
And I found this game impossible. I typically will try a boss about 10 times before I give up. I loved this game to try more times than that, even though the save points tend to be a distance away from the boss fights making it difficult to do so.
But this game was difficult enough that I decided, as good as it was, it wasn't worth it.
So, I recommend get this game if you are good at video games or extremely patient. I do not recommend this game for casual gamers like me.

This game helped me through my depression
i think i'd be dead by now. but this new vast world kept me alive, calling me to explore it, hallownest is a gorgeus place, i think everyone should pay a visit.
thanks

This game is one of the best games I've played in a long time. The combat is fun, tight, and satisfying. Some parts are defintely a challenge, but never feel impossibly hard. The world is absolutely stunning, and its inhabitants are all unique and interesting. The music is also on point with one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while.
10/10
TLDR: This game is a masterpiece, buy it now!
Posted: January 25, 2022
The best game I've ever played, amazing story, fluid gameplay, NPC's well planned to the point that some of them become special for you, don't try to find imperfections in this game, it's impossible (Except Zote, he's definitely a mistake), the narrative of the game keeps you immersed for hours, and with each new area discovered, things got even more interesting. I was moved by the story of some NPC's and each ending is simply epic, especially if you understood the whole story of the game until the end. I started playing this game in the summer of 2021, in one of the worst phases of my life, sinking into my depression day after day, I didn't eat right and I just thought about getting home soon and going to sleep, so my best friend encouraged me to play Hollow Knight on call with him, each playing their own save and helping the other when one was stuck somewhere, and it's inexplicable how much this game did for me. I came home from work exhausted, and my moment of happiness was opening steam and playing the game until I needed to sleep. As the days went by I was able to eat better, I could handle the events that happened during the day, I even managed to go back to college, that's when I realized how much hollow knight did me good, it gave me strength to continue at a time that I had already given up on myself. Recently after 142 hours of gameplay (103 hours on main save) I finally completed the 63 achievements (some friends called me crazy), it was difficult and required a lot of dedication and practice, but I feel like I should do this in gratitude and respect for the game that possibly changed my life. Hollow Knight is amazing and I assure you that the money and time invested in this game is worth A LOT. All my thanks to Team Cherry for this wonderful game, and to my best friend for always supporting me and also motivating me to play this masterpiece.

The longer the development of silksong, the more hollow I become.
Posted: July 11, 2017
Hollow Knight is a truly ambitious metroidvania released by small indie developer Team Cherry in Adelaide, South Australia. Hollow Knight includes many platforming elements as well as an ARPG feel and looting mechanic, all in a side-scrolling presentation. From the beginning, the player is overwhelmed by the magnificent hand-drawn art, unique style, and darkly contrasting color palette. This glorious world of bugs is overflowing with originality, and well, it‚Äôs just pure ‚Äúeye candy.‚Äù
The open-world feel of the game leaves the player free to explore in many directions, yet it‚Äôs devoid of ‚Äúneon signs‚Äù and ‚Äúgo here‚Äù instructions, leaving the player free to explore and learn about this magnificent world all on his or her own. This is truly a self-paced game, and it can be played in short increments or lengthy sittings, according to the player‚Äôs individual gaming style and preferences.
Sooner or later, the player will find that what felt like wide open space, narrows a bit, because it‚Äôs discovered that items or abilities are needed in order to progress from one area to another. Backtracking will become a staple until the player figures out what‚Äôs missing or meets the requirement to progress into the new area. For some players, this is frustrating, but for others, it‚Äôs exhilarating, a true adventure. Finding each area‚Äôs ‚Äúcartographer‚Äù to unlock the map for the area will be essential. One of the most jaw-dropping moments for me as a gamer was to view the massive scale of the pieced together map for the game world once every area had been mapped; it was truly awe-inspiring.
Through the course of gameplay, one encounters a multitude of majestic and downright ferocious-looking bugs. The imagination leaps right out of this marvelous world and drags the player right down into this thoroughly encompassing environment. From the shapes and colors to the music, it all creates a fantasy world like I have yet to experience anywhere in games or literature ever before.
Spelunkers and treasure hunters will enjoy delving into the depths of this truly massive game world while adventurers and explorers will find a metric ton of secrets, that is, if they‚Äôre paying attention. Environmental cues abound, so the player will learn to use and/or hone observational skills during the course of gameplay. From the sound of walking, flying, or running water to the pace of the accompanying musical tracks, absolutely everything feels deliberate.
It is a true rarity to find a game that is this enjoyable, especially one built to such a massive scale and crammed so full of genius, so it may come as a surprise to learn that even above and beyond all of that there is an extremely well thought out storyline. The player wants to learn about these creatures, most importantly the hollow knight and the masked hero, and to discover how this world came to be in its current state and what will become of it.
It‚Äôs impossible to encounter every variance on one playthrough. There are certain charms that may lock out others if obtained in a particular order, NPCs that are to either be saved or killed, hidden areas, ‚Äúsecret‚Äù NPCs, collectibles to be found, grubs to be ‚Äúfreed‚Äù and up to 4 different endings. With all the hidden pathways, secret areas and hidden dialogue options used to discover the lore of this world, it‚Äôs an amazing amount of content.
Combat is fluid and balanced, and the upgrade method is as close to perfect as I‚Äôve ever seen. From the main weapon (nail) upgrade mechanic to the collection of charms, each has its own mechanic, use, or benefit. Enemy bugs possess unique strengths and weaknesses as well as their own attack and defense systems. Timing is essential for a lot of these battles, so don‚Äôt be discouraged if your character dies frequently while you figure that out. There is no permadeath or loss of items and upgrades with Hollow Knight, so you are free to ‚Äúdie, die, again‚Äù until you get it right.
Hollow Knight sports full controller support, and it is indeed smooth. A controller is definitely recommended for the game, and I had no issues with either the Xbox 360 or Steam Controller. Bosses can be truly brutal, so to that end, I‚Äôve created a playlist to help you with some of the most challenging areas, bosses, and grubs.

There is also a fast travel mechanic accomplished by the stagway and railway systems and a separate storyline involving the stagway system, so you won‚Äôt want to neglect these. Fast traveling will save a great deal of time as you revisit areas to reach or access something you couldn‚Äôt before.
I did encounter just a couple of oddities or glitches that have been added to the #GamersRule ‚ÄúHall of Weird.‚Äù

However, with this amount of content, I would have been concerned if I hadn‚Äôt encountered at least something while exploring the world of Hollow Knight. It‚Äôs mind-boggling to me that Team Cherry created such an enormous game world and that it‚Äôs as close to perfect as this one appears to be. I have over 260 hours in-game, and yet I still have more to accomplish thanks to the upcoming update sometime this month which introduces a new method for fast travel (Dark Gates) and new bosses. I have a feeling Team Cherry isn't done with this world quite yet, and we may even see an expansion or sequel in the near future. This reviewer sure hopes so. Until next time.

Looks good, plays good, feels good. Beating path of pain is more pleasurable than sex.
Posted: June 11, 2021
There will be times when you only want to keep playing more and there will be times when you don't want anything to do with the game ever again. There will be obstacles and there will be sweet moments of victory. You will be amused and you will be frustrated. You will cry and you will laugh. You will say "awww" and you will say "‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• piece of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• insect". You will die and you will triumph.
This is the video game known as Hollow Knight.
10/10
EDIT: I've now spent 138 hours playing the game, did 112%, did absolutely everything in it, including all Pantheons with all bindings, Path of Pain, speedruns, steel soul mode, saw every ending, got every Steam achievement. And I have slowly come to the conclusion that, regardless of genre, Hollow Knight is one of the best video games ever made. It was developed by a team of only four people, a game designer/director, an animator, a programmer, and a composer/sound designer. And what those four people managed to create is something truly unique and amazing.
All I can now do before the sequel comes out is to play The Eternal Ordeal over and over again...

Best indie game ever in my opinion.
Posted: February 3, 2021
THIS GAME IS LITERALLY 100+ HOURS OF CONTENT FOR 15 DOLLARS GIVE TEAM CHERRY YOUR MONEY PLEASE
Posted: July 30, 2018
Hollow Knight started out as a humble Kickstarter campaign in November 2014. The publisher/developer, Team Cherry from Australia, managed to raise just over $57,000 AU to fund their project. After what seemed like a long and exhausting wait, however update and content filled it may have been, the indie project finally hit the digital shelf in February 2017. As it stands, Hollow Knight has been deemed top-tier of the Metroidvania genre time and time again, and for a very well rounded myriad of reasons.
The story of Hollow Knight is vague and sparse, yet it becomes somewhat easier to understand the further that one travels within the game. Rather than being given a direct story, the plot unfolds throughout interactions with various creatures and objects; talking to NPCs multiple times over until they start repeating themselves is essential. In a nutshell and without giving too much away, our hero Hollow Knight has ventured to the land of Hallownest, first encountering the above-ground city of Dirtmouth. It soon becomes evident that he needs to break the three seals of the Black Temple in order to uncover the full truth of what happened to the now ruined and infested world. The infection and fate of the residents becomes explained in further detail, and the game houses a total of three endings to enjoy.
As with all Metroidvania titles, Hollow Knight is hard; there's absolutely no denying the challenge that it brings players, regardless of their new or veteran status within the genre. However, rather than pummeling gamers with high-octane action, the overall atmosphere is surprisingly relaxing, yet at times utterly disturbing. There's an odd sense of comfort within the bug-ridden landscapes and caverns that's mostly heralded by a dreamy ambience and matching soundtrack. With that said, don't be fooled into thinking that there aren't a plethora of frantic platforming sections, boss battles, and mini-bosses, not to mention the insane arena challenges that lay deep within the bowels of Hallownest, but know that fast action is not the primary focus of the gameplay.
Much of the difficulty can be compared to the Dark Souls series, in that every death can cause the player irreversible agony. Charms (add-on skills) and weapon upgrades are purchased with currency known as Geo, which is collected from nodes and foes. Whatever Geo is on the player at the time of death is completely lost to the void, but there is a bank where up to 4,500 can be deposited. It should also be noted that many charms are made to break upon death, and once they are broken they are unusable for the rest of the game. However, one does have the potential to recover lost Geo by returning to, and claiming, their death shroud at the place of their untimely demise.
As players adventure and explore the world of Hallownest and its many subsections, they will both discover and be rewarded with new skills. Many of them allow access to new areas, such as the ability to double jump, dash, use "magic", and hurtle through the air endlessly until striking a wall. Given the vastness of the world, Hollow Knight has a great map system in place that can also be upgraded by purchasing upgrades from shopkeepers. Each section of the game requires an area map, which also means that gamers must find the mapmaker in each location. While the mapmaker fills out a small portion of each area on the map, it's up to players to fill out the rest of it by means of exploration. There are also multiple ways to traverse the terrain, whether it be by manual navigation or taking special Stagway Stations and Trams from one side of the map to the other.
To put it simply, Hollow Knight is an outstanding title. The art direction is rich with lavish detail, yet still kept cartoony with a style that's reminiscent of Edmund McMillen's work. There's no words that can do justice to just how eerily awe-inspiring the soundtrack is, either. Each area of the game has its own set of tunes, and every single one of them is haunting and brilliantly captivating. Team Cherry are also still supporting Hollow Knight well over a year since its initial release by adding numerous free DLC packs, with the final one coming in on August 23, 2018. Needless to say, if you're a fan of Metroidvania style games, then picking up Hollow Knight is a no-brainer; it's even well worth it at full price. Here's to hoping that there's a second release in the future.
Rating: 5.0/5.0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.

Near top of the list or possibly the best metroidvania game I've ever played. The level of polish, attention to detail and sheer scope of the game is borderline unbelievable. I've enjoyed every hour I've played of Hollow Knight and highly recommend the game for fans of the genre. The soundtrack is also fantastic and worth a purchase as well.

This game is like crack. Just the right amount of challenge and reward. Also a classic metroidvania, please ignore the comparisons to dark souls.

I went into this game unable to tell if it was quite as great as everyone said it was. Also expecting a standard 15 hour indie game, and yeah, I liked some games like it. I was definitely wrong about the amount of content, I found 30 hours in where I still had so much left to do. I spent a little while lost and feeling like I wasn't getting my powers quite as fast as I liked. Then it all started coming together. The atmosphere already had me, the vague and mysterious ways of breadcrumbing the lore was slowly getting to me, and I found myself drawn more and more into the world. I had my doubts, and I definitely had my frustrations, but I have to say, this game is a masterstroke in video game world building and gameplay structure. Everything I did felt earned, attainable, all I had to do was explore. It took a while to get there, but I don't regret a bit of it. It's simple to pick up and play, but much harder to master, but this is one of the few games that I could notably FEEL myself getting better at within around 30 hours in... and it feels incredible. I don't replay a lot of games, and I never expected myself to love this one this much, but as I am finishing it up... I'm seriously considering playing it again alrady. Not everyone will love this either, but I think if you like the look and the simple mechanics enough, it's almost assured you'll enjoy this.

So here I was, ‚Ç¨15 game. Sitting in my list for months. Decided to blow through it during my final week of summer holiday. I was wrong.
You don‚Äôt blow through Hollow Knight in a day if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôre going to be a broken man/woman when you come back from this. Hollow Knight is so deceptively massive it puts other games to shame. Also take into account the consistent art style, amazing music and captivating story and lore and you‚Äôre looking at the most incredible bang for your buck.
Hollow Knight throws you into the depths of Hallownest. A forgotten insect kingdom that has long since been reduced to destitute and ruin. Only a small town and divided tribes remain. Enter you, a small stag beetle with a black cloak and a rusty nail, devoid of memory and burdened with a purpose to seek out a great evil and seal it. Along the road, you‚Äôll meet many other characters who either sympathise with your quest to downright try to murder you. Slowly, but surely you‚Äôll uncover what has happened to Hallownest and what your real goal is.
As a Metroidvania, Hollow Knight doesn‚Äôt hold your hand too long. It gives you the basics and immediately throws you into the deep end. No, that‚Äôs not right. It throws you in a pool with three deep ends, and none of them warn you about the sudden drop-off. Hollow Knight is entirely non-linear. Certainly, some obstacles need to be passed before you‚Äôre able to clear some definite roadblocks, but even then, the game is not going to stop you from going about it exactly the way you want it. This is incredible, because it allows you to go on a real exploration. This is also disheartening when you run into a brick wall and have no idea how to get around it without learning how to play at a level you were never eased into.
Hollow Knight can be quite hard the first time through. Not just Dark Souls hard, but Megaman hard. The only way to really clear some of the fights is by learning and getting better. There are no real workarounds or cheese methods.
That doesn‚Äôt mean Hollow Knight is impossible. It‚Äôs just a surprising change from what you‚Äôd expect from a game that looks like an early 80ies Disney film concept. I got stuck on a nasty boss with a lot of magical powers and a long walk to its room I couldn‚Äôt beat without snapping my controller in half. I decided to leave the area and explore other parts of the game. Eventually I went through roughly three times as many areas as I had already explored. Acquired a much stronger weapon, more health and practice.
Your character, the Knight, starts out weak, like Samus would in Metroid, but gains more power and abilities over the course of the game. However, unlike the former trendsetter, the Knight‚Äôs options don‚Äôt open up so clearly as they to do Samus. There are no brightly coloured doors or jumps that seem to far without an augment. Hollow Knight has you chart your progress on a map. Since it only updates when you save, it‚Äôll often show blank spaces and gaps for you to try and find a way through with your new ability. The map mechanic in general is very well designed and is used much more frequently than you would in Metroid. Although that might be because I know Metroid maps by heart these days.
Combat in Hollow Knight is another important element to master. You must come to respect all its aspects. From jumping and slashing to focussing and pogo, it‚Äôs essential you make yourself familiar with everything to even stand a chance. To help you there are charms. Little upgrade tags you can equip in a limited capacity to augment your abilities. However, there are no hard counters to any enemy or boss in the game, so you‚Äôll still need to do the work yourself. It becomes rewarding, but can also be stressful.
That doesn‚Äôt mean it is all bad news. From the moment you begin, you‚Äôre thrust into a beautiful world with so many mysteries to ponder you‚Äôll be forgiven for dying while admiring the view. Dark caverns, lush forests, shining mines, dreary cities and ghastly pits are all par for the course. Another thing to lose yourself over are the enemy animations, which are clear and telegraph incoming attacks well. Making it possible to at least learn enemy patterns before being sent back to the bench. Furthermore, there are over 150 different enemies, so a lot of work went into preserving the variety. So even in the furthest regions of Hallownest, you‚Äôll be running into new threats.
The sound helps to sell this bug-infested hell hole. Great care was taken to create a nuanced set of ambient and action effects that help sell the world. However, we cannot ignore the incredible soundtrack. Hollow Knight is accompanied by very subtle, but an effective score. The soft tunes add incredible character to any scene. The elegiac nature of the score makes the world so much more fleshed out. It‚Äôs like walking into the Phendrana Drifts in Metroid Prime over and over again.
I think that a special mention has to go out the final boss. Not only is this bad boy hard, but it is also a great case of boss design because it will test you on everything. The boss‚Äô attacks are straight out of the books from all the other bosses and even the insanely hard platforming gets a show.
I managed to beat the game at 106% at the end of my first playthrough. I didn‚Äôt even do everything there was to do. I didn‚Äôt beat a hard boss from the second content pack. I didn‚Äôt fight all the rematches. I also couldn‚Äôt pull off a victory against the pantheon boss rush from the last content pack. Forget the Path of Pain or the Steel Soul mode. It‚Äôs not for me. However, even after passing on those parts of the game, the rest of the is so insanely rich in content you‚Äôll be hard-pressed to feel buyer remorse. Even if you‚Äôre not into somewhat challenging, massive non-linear action-adventure games with compelling art style and beautiful music, then at least you owe it to the industry to support this effort.

A masterpiece.
The dark and misty environment, the story mainly underground, and some moments reminding of Tim Burton's films may give a feeling of depression. This is for me what makes the charm of the game.
The melancholic music fits perfectly and polish this unhealthy atmosphere.
The controls are very responsive and the spells enjoyable. The icing on the cake is the high number of skills and all possible combinations.
Overall, every associations are viable depending on how you play.
Customizing a character is always very welcome, especially when the changes are so visible and smart.
Congratulations to Team Cherry for all the love and care they brought to their creation. I highly recommend.

Factor	Rating	Description
Gameplay Loop	9	There's basically 2 main things you do in the game: Combat and Exploration. Both of them are just as engaging as the other. Finding shards, grubs, abilities, notches, charms and sometimes whole ass areas is extremely rewarding. The boss fights are pristine as well, and all the game systems feed into each other really really well. I will say doe that the world enemies aren't super engaging, and the game does take its time to set up until you get the first couple abilities, so some people might quit early on - but I promise it's incredible after that.
Narrative	7	Whether it's the NPC's, levels design, random monuments you find, the items etc - everything keeps adding answers and questions you'd have about the world. I'm not too much of a "lore" guy, for me it's about how the world and it's story feels overall, with a vague interpretation of "that's how it once was damn". And Hollow Knight does that really well. The little mini stories of the NPCs are interesting, and it even uses the "dream nail" mechanic for some little storytelling mixed with the gameplay when you fight with certain warriors in their peak, and once you literally fight a girl's "image" of this dude about how great a warrior he is lmao. Then there's subtle storytelling through the level design itself about how it's always raining the City of Tears, and hence it has the Royal Waterways - a sewer level right below it. Little things like these add verisimilitude to the world.
Visuals	10	I don't even know where to begin with the visuals lmao. Out of the 3 videos I've gotten myself to make yet, one of em is literally about Hollow Knight's visual design. You get the idea. I love the aesthetic, I love the variety it has across areas, I love the smooth animations. I love how it uses the color black. It's perfect.
Mechanics	10	Extremely polished, whether we're talking about the basic movement, the combat, or the abilities. The combat mechanics really hold their own, even when you push em to their limit. It's very consistent and well done, and synergize well with the dash, double jump, charms etc. Speaking of the dash though, one hiccup I noticed was that if you're facing left and press dash - you dash left, which is great. But if you press right with the dash, you still go left a lot of the times. If you press right before the dash, you always go right though. So that middle ground where it's shaky what direction you end up dashing in really only matters in very intense boss fights or challenges like the  but it's worth pointing out regardless. Apart from that, I found it weird that the superdash thingy cannot be canceled once fully charged, but a commenter just pointed out that there actually is a way to do this, so wth I'll just make this a 10.
Challenge	9	I'm surprised how this game has nearly NO weak bosses?? It kind of blows my mind how creatively they use the same 2D space to create so many unique boss fights that feel both mechanically and aesthetically unique. I do wish there were more platforming challenges though. I did do the  and that only made me want more, since the mechanics have all this potential. Wish there was more of that. The third kind of challenge was in the exploration, which was amazing as well. Finding new paths, making connections, unlocking more of the map while feeling lost was a really engaging experience. I do think it could've been MUCH better with 2 more things: 1. The warp back to bonfire takes away a lot from the experience. I didn't realize you could do this, and when I did, the tension was gone by a lot. The game should start from exactly where you quit to menu. And 2. The actual enemies you encounter while exploring are not difficult at all, TBH. And while I think the challenge was great in the game, I 'almost' never died at all outside of like 6-7 boss fights, which were all optional, and the platforming challenges. While the boss fight difficulty is subjective, I do think the normal enemies pose too less a challenge, unless we're talking about the Trials. Overall, still an excellent Challenge design.
Variety	10	The abilities, the areas, the boss fights, enemy types, music, visual design - and more so how all these go together is nothing short of unfairly perfect.
Mapping	10	Some of my favorite games ever have ended up giving me "spaces" that felt well-realized, memorable, and engaging to explore. And from now on, I can't say that line without thinking of Hollow Knight. When I started the game, I had no idea HOW HUGE this world was going to be. The exploration feels almost endless, imagine you feel around different books of a library and you keep finding more and more chambers that do not stop opening. I remember reaching a sort of mid/end game area  VERY early on in the game, and I didn't know you could just checkpoint back to the prv bench, so there was a point where I was so lost I considered restarting the game because of feeling completely lost. No benches. No stags. Just darkness. Got beaten down to my last health shred, and then suddenly  One of my best gaming experiences.
Sound	10	No game should be allowed this much power.
Interface	9	I love you need to explore to buy the map, then fill it up, which then gives you the map, creating a layered navigation design. One lil prob I do have is that you don't get to zoom into the map when you open it. But when you press RB to open the "on the move" map, it's much more zoomed in. Thus, they had a more detailed map - so it would've been great to control how zoomed in you wanna be.
Pricing & Performance	9	For a game full of bugs, it doesn't seem to have any (im sry). But yeah, the pricing is worth much more than they're asking for, and the performance is smooth and optimized. I did have these little issues with the controller though, and a friend did as well. Sometimes it would require a restart for it to read my controller if I ended up using the mouse. Also, sometimes the left trigger would stop working, but it worked in other games perfectly and in this one too after a restart, so IDK?
Replay Value	7	There's really good replay value due to optional challenges, pantheon, steel mode, etc. The lack of NG+ definitely takes some away from me, though. While I know the game is designed for a fresh playthrough with exploration, I'm sure having those abilities from the get-go could be a fun convenience reward, while replacing all the acquired goods with geo rocks or something. I would have much more motivation to do a couple of shards/grubs etc. I missed if it was an NG+ since I feel done once credits roll.
DLC (Not in score)	10	"If DLC was always this good, EA would be the best company"
SCORE : 9.1/10

At first I was hating on the game for being too hard. I was frustrated as I suck at figuring things out by myself but I still kept exploring(videos of Relyea helped a lot) and slowly started making progress. In the end the feeling of satisfaction I got after completing it was amazing.Hollow knight is huge! Seriously the amount of dedication put into this game is just mind blowing. The map, characters, soundtrack,boss fights(although some of them almost made me cry ) everything about this game are great. No wonder why many consider it as the best metroidvania game.Thanks to team cherry.

Back in 1986, in Japan, Nintendo released the game called Metroid. Which instantly got the attention thanks to its non-linear gameplay. Another famous non-linear title that was released that year was The Legend of Zelda, but unlike Zelda, Metroid combined non-linear gameplay with our usual side-scrolling one. It looked and felt like typical side-scrolling shooter, but it also had non-linear gameplay, which felt unexpectedly good. Actually, it was so good that the second chapter in The Legend of Zelda series tried to do exactly the same. Zelda II: The Adventure of Link combined the big open world from the first game with Metroid's side-scrolling mechanics. And guess what? Zelda wasn't even the only series that did that. Akumaj≈ç Dracula, also known for English-speaking people as Castlevania, the first game of which was also released in 1986, did exactly the same in its second game called Simon's Quest. Which was absolutely fantastic, but heavily ruined for English-speaking players thanks to a very confusing translation. Anyway, more time have passed, The Legend of Zelda switched back to its old meachanics in A Link to the Past and then made a huge revolution in genre with Ocarina of Time. Castlevania, on the other hand, did exactly the opposite. It kept playing with the formula to finally achieve something absolutely brilliant. Of course, I'm talking about Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The game that everybody loves. It was just that - a perfect blend between Metroid and Castlevania's dark setting. That's the story of the genre that people call ‚Äúmetroidvania‚Äù. A genre, in which side-scrolling gameplay is perfectly mixed with non-linear exploration. Why am I telling you all that? Well, that's because that's exactly what we have here. A charming little metroidvania.
To be completely honest, though... I wasn't that excited when this game came out. A lot of people were excited about it, it got a lot of positive reviews from both press and the actual players, but I was just sitting there, looking at screenshots and thinking ‚ÄúMeh, here comes another cute little indie something...‚Äù It's hard to say why exactly, but I wasn't really excited about it. Like... at all. Screenshots looked cute, but... they didn't make me want to actually buy and play the game right away. Thankfully, there was a friend of mine who just bought it to me and forced me to play it. Just because he loved the game oh-so-much. And guess what? It didn't took me long to fall in love with this game too.
Hollow Knight just has that something that makes you love it right away. Right after you begin playing it... you feel like you want to stay. Which, I must admit, isn't the most common thing among indie titles. I mean, I buy and play a lot of indie titles. Many of them are good. Some are very good. But still, most of the time they don't have that something that makes your feelings click. That something that makes you want to forget about everything and just keep sacrificing all of your free time to a single game. Hollow Knight is the game that made me feel like a five years old kid with the NES all over again. Why? Well... the answer isn't that simple. Just because there are many reasons for that.
First of all, Hollow Knight follows a formula of another popular franchise, Dark Souls, in its way to tell you the story. When you'll arrive in the world of Hollow Knight, you'll be lost and confused, but not in the bad way. Instead of feeling bad, you'll feel like you want to stay, explore and get some answers. And you'll sure get them, but again, you won't get them directly. By visiting different places and talking with different characters, you'll get the story in a form of scattered pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. Will you be able to connect them in the right way to get the full picture or not is entirely up to you. Such thing sure worked in the From Software's series and it sure works here. As great as it can be. Which feels even more good thanks to amazing atmosphere that is made of fantastic 2D backgrounds, smooth handmade animation and the incredible soundtrack. Like Bastion, Hollow Knight is one of those games that will make you want to pay more just for the soundtrack, while visuals feel way better in action thanks to how it's never about still images. Hollow Knight is full of beautoful animations that make it feel alive. In other words, Hollow Knight is one of those games that will make you want to live in it.
But, like I've already said, that's not the only reason why this game is so good. The thing is, even though it was literally made by only two people (Ari Gibson and William Pellen), the gameplay is so great and polished that it feels like you're playing one of those expensive titles from Nintendo. I'm not kidding. Remember Metroid: Samus Returns from 3DS? Hollow Knight is something that you can seriously compare with it. And it just blows my mind. Just think about it. Two guys... made a metroidvania game... that can be seriously compared... with the real deal... BOOM! Mind blown. Everything in Hollow Knight feels just right. The difficulty depends only on how ambitious you are (like in the Dark Souls and Bloodborne, you can take your time and finish the game in the easy way, or rush for all achievements and the hard battles, the decision is entirely yours). The controls are very responsive, which means that even in the hardest battles it'll be all about you and your skill. Not about ‚ÄúDang! The freakin' controls made me die again!‚Äù like in some other games (you know which ones I mean, I'm sure). The map is advanced enough to make you find your way easily, but at the same time you'll unlock it step by step, which means that it won't ruin the exploration feeling (at certain points you'll probably need to draw some maps by hand, like in the good old times, which feels absolutely awesome). The levels have enough variety and come with some really, really nice design, which is absolutely rare thing to see nowadays. Et cetera, et cetera. Even in the small details this game shines very bright. For example, some of the hidden areas here are very well hidden. But it won't feel bad, because every single time there'll be a hint. Like some light coming through the wall, some cracks on the rocks (hello, The Legend of Zelda fans), some sound hints (Gold Skulltulas, ho!~)...
The best thing about Hollow Knight (at least in my opinion) is that it's a game that feels absolutely right. In every place possible. Add the multiple endings, free DLC that feel surprisingly good and well-integrated into the main game, full gamepad support and other things like that, and you'll see why everybody loves this game so much. Hollow Knight feels like its creators didn't just want to make a product to sell. It feels like above everything else Ari Gibson and William Pellen wanted to make a game they'll enjoy playing by themselves. Sure, it's not like we din't have enough metroidvanias already. But it's a very rare thing to see the game that is as full of love and passion as this one. The game that just feels absolutely and completely right and it's impossible not to love it.
Dixi.
